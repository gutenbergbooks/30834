<h2><a name="WHATS_THE_USE_OF_IT" id="WHATS_THE_USE_OF_IT"></a>WHAT'S THE USE OF IT?</h2>

<h3>A CHRISTMAS STORY</h3>

<p>In a village that was close to the great forest,
though it had already become the suburb of a
large town, lived a little girl named Hansi
Herzchen. She was the seventh child of a family
of seven, and she lived at No 7 &mdash;&mdash; Street. So
you see she was a lucky child, for seven is always
a lucky number; but nothing had happened to
prove her luck as yet.</p>

<p>Her father was a clerk in the post office at the
neighbouring town. He would have found it hard
to make two ends meet with seven little mouths
to fill, but that his wife had brought him substantial
help. She was the daughter of a well-to-do
farmer peasant and had a considerable dowry
when she married. Moreover she was extremely
thrifty and industrious. She never spent a halfpenny
without carefully considering if a farthing
would not do as well. Better &pound;1 in the pocket
than 19s. 11&frac12;d., she used to say. She drove
wonderful bargains at the market. She had no
eyes for the artistic and ornamental, though her
house was so spick and span, that it was good to
look at in its cleanliness and order. She had
stored up everything she had possessed since her
early youth, and was said to use pins that were
at least twenty years old. She managed to put
everything to use, and the boys' knickers were
sometimes made of queer materials.</p>

<p>One expression little Hansi often heard at home
and that was the word "<i>useful</i>." When she
brought in a fresh bunch of darling, pink-tipped
daisies and wanted to find a corner for them and
a tiny drop of water to put them in, the whole
family would exclaim: "Throw them away, what
do you want with those half-dead weeds; they're
of no use." If one of the neighbours gave her a
ball or toy, it was the same story: "We've no
room for such rubbish here." Each child possessed
a money-box, and every coin was immediately
put in. They had never had a penny to
<i>spend</i> in their lives.</p>

<p>The garden was planted solely with vegetables
and potatoes and herbs of the most useful character.
The scarlet beans in summer, however,
would brighten it up, and field poppies and dandelions
sprang up in a quite miraculous way to
Hansi's delight. For in each flower was a jolly
little fairy, who talked to her and told her stories,
because of her being a seventh child and living
at No. 7. Perhaps, too, because Hansi's natural
disposition made her look out for wonders, and
her loving heart included the field flowers among
her friends.</p>

<p>Christmas was coming on; a pig had been killed.
Hansi's father and mother and big brother Paul
stayed up all night making sausages, and the
children had sausage soup for dinner during the
next week.</p>

<p>In preparation for Christmas, Hansi's mother
baked large cakes (called Stollen) of a plain
quality, with currants few and far between. Food
had become very expensive during the last few
years, and no one could deny that seven children
were a handful.</p>

<p>She went in to town and returned by electric
tram, with the useful things that were intended
for Christmas presents for the children, namely:</p>

</div>

<p>"Now we might be said to have everything
ready for Christmas," said Mrs Herzchen, on her
return home, "if it were not for the Christmas
tree. I suppose we shall have to pay at least
one and six for it, and then there are the candles
and apples, balls and sweets. It does seem
absurd to waste good money on such rubbish.
What can be the use of it?"</p>

<p>She talked away in this manner, until she made
up her mind to do without the tree for once.</p>

<p>"Your father has no time to see about it," she
said to the children. "He is taken up with looking
after other people's rubbishing letters and
parcels, and I can't be bothered&mdash;so put the idea
out of your heads, you won't get a tree this year."</p>

<p>The seven children felt very indignant; for it
is almost a disgrace in Germany to have no tree;
it is worse than going without a pudding on
Christmas Day in England. The very poorest
families manage somehow to have their tree to
light on Christmas Eve. Still they were trained
to implicit obedience and respect for their mother,
and did not dare grumble much openly.</p>

<p>Mrs Herzchen did not consult her husband
about it; so he expected his tree as usual. The
good woman felt rather uncomfortable, as if she
had either done something wrong, or omitted
doing what was right; but she justified herself by
saying continually to herself "What's the use
of it?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hansi dreamt that night of a beautiful Christmas
tree that reached up to the sky and was
covered with shining silver, like cobwebs in the
frost, and lit by real stars. She determined that
somehow or other they should have their Christmas
tree as usual.</p>

<p>When she came out of school at eleven o'clock,
she trotted along in the opposite way to home,
along the wide high road leading to the woods,
with the twisted apple-trees on either side. She
made a little bobbing curtsy, and said "good
day" to everyone she met who noticed her at all;
for she had been taught to be polite and friendly.</p>

<p>The ground was frozen and sparkled brightly;
the air brought the fresh colour into her cheeks.
She had on a warm hood and cape and a woollen
scarf&mdash;for her mother was kind-hearted at the
bottom and looked well after their material
comforts. Hansi's pretty fair curls peeped out
from under the red hood, her blue eyes with their
dark lashes were more starry than usual from
excitement.</p>

<p>The fir woods looked purple-black against the
white fields, and as she came near, she saw the fir-trees
covered with silver hoar frost "almost like
the tree in my dream," she thought. Her heart
beat faster for a moment as she entered the shade
of the solemn evergreen trees, but she did not feel
naughty to be running away from home. She
felt rather as if she were fulfilling a mission that
had been laid upon her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her mother was worrying and wondering
what could have happened that her little
girl did not return at the usual time. Then she
remembered that Hansi often went home with her
friend Barbara Arndt, and then they did their
lessons together before dinner. That doubtless
accounted for her non-appearance.</p>

<p>Hansi wandered on and on, and the woods
seemed deserted. She picked up fir cones and
beech nuts and acorns and filled her pinafore
with them, also frosted fern leaves and dry
grasses exquisitely outlined with hoar frost went
into her apron.</p>

<p>At last she stopped before a little fir-tree. This
was just the beautiful little tree she wanted. It
spread out its branches symmetrically on all sides,
and was slender and straight at the top. "That
will just do for me! If only I could get it home,"
she thought. She tugged at it with her little
hands, dropping some of her treasures, but of
course it would not move. Just then she heard
something stir, and looking round she saw a
squirrel peeping at her from behind a big oak-tree
near by. This was a wonder in itself if she had
known; for squirrels are usually fast asleep in the
cold weather, and only wake once or twice to eat
some of their store of nuts.</p>

<p>"O, Mr Squirrel, can't you help me," Hansi
said. Off he went, round and round the trunk,
and then suddenly, with a great spring and his
tail spread out for a sail, he alighted on Hansi's
tree. He stared at her in a friendly way, and
then stretched out one of his dear little paws and
offered her a nut, politely cracking it for her first
with his sharp teeth which had grown very long
whilst he was asleep. She ate it at once, but
looked anxious. "O, Mr Squirrel, do cut down
this tree for me, and help me to carry it home,"
she said, "or else we shall have no Christmas tree,
and that would be <i>dreadful</i>!"</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke. Mr
Squirrel looked at her with his bright eyes, twisted
round suddenly, like a cat trying to catch its own
tail, and offered her another nut.</p>

<p>"O, Mr Squirrel, <i>do</i>," she said again.</p>

<p>He offered her a third nut, and then he whistled
shrilly; it sounded more like a baby crying than
a whistle. Then to her surprise, as she looked
down the wood path, Hansi saw a troop of little
men, such as you see on Christmas cards in
Germany, with red caps and green jackets and
wooden shoes turned up at the toes. "Real
Heinzelmen and no mistake," thought Hansi
delightedly, "they can help me, if anyone can."
She counted them, they were seven in number, like
Snowdrop's dwarfs. They made quite a noise as
they marched up in order, whistling a merry tune.
When they saw Hansi, they took off their red
caps, and their white hair flew about them like
a mist, till Hansi could hardly see them any more.
The squirrel screamed and shouted at them, and
they answered him; but Hansi could not understand
at first what it was all about. She thought
they must be talking English; she knew a lady
who lived near them, and who could only talk
English, poor thing. All of a sudden the earth
trembled&mdash;was it an earthquake? Hansi held
tight on to the fir-tree, though its needles hurt
her hands. All she saw was the seven little men
disappearing into the ground down a long slide
such as firemen use, when they are called
suddenly from sleep, and are carried by a new
mechanical apparatus direct from one floor to the
other. The earth closed up again, and Hansi
thought it must be all a dream; but in two seconds
they were back again with silver hatchets and
silver pails. With the hatchets they immediately
began to hack away at the tree. They made
tremendous efforts, and became quite red in the
face. The last moment before it was finally
felled, the squirrel bounded off, and tossed a nut
to Hansi, who caught it cleverly in her pinafore.</p>

<p>"Dear little men," she said, "may I have the
tree? Will you bring it home for me, and I will
give you all my Christmas cake? But I have
nothing to hang on it, and make it pretty," she
continued. The dwarfs began to chatter again
like so many girls, all trying to say the same thing
at once. Then they marched along, dragging the
tree with them.</p>

<p>"O, Mr Dwarf, that's the wrong way home,
I'm sure," said Hansi. But she followed them
all the same. They came to where a crystal
stream leapt over a little group of rocks. The
dwarfs held their buckets under the cascade, and
caught some drops. The drops turned into silver
fish, each with a little loop on the end of its tail,
all ready to hang on the tree.</p>

<p>They then took Hansi's pine cones and ferns
and grasses, and even collected the frozen cobwebs
from the bushes and let the spray from the
waters fall on them, and lo and behold the most
exquisite gems were ready for the decoration of
the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>"You live at No 7, and you are seven years
old," said the eldest of the dwarfs, addressing
Hansi. ("However <i>could</i> he have known that?"
she thought.) "Perhaps you can tell me what
seven times seven makes?"</p>

<p>Hansi considered a moment. "No, we have
not got so far as that in our arithmetic," she
replied. "<i>Twice</i> seven is fourteen, that I know."</p>

<p>"Seven times seven is forty-nine and is the
square of seven," said the dwarf. "Always
remember that, for it is a most important fact in
magic!"</p>

<p>Rummaging in his pocket, he took out a note-book
and handed a leaf to her with this diagram
and inscription on it</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="4" summary="diagram">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

    </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>"Thank you <i>very</i> much," said Hansi, feeling
duly impressed, and she never forgot this difficult
fact in the multiplication table again, although
she didn't quite understand the diagram, and in
fact lost it on the way home.</p>

<p>The dwarfs set up the tree on a clear part of the
path, and made a little stand for it of boughs
cleverly intertwined and moss between. With
many a hop, skip and jump of delight, they hung
the silver fish and cones and nuts on it; the cobwebs
spread themselves out all over the tree.
Then they took red holly berries, and stuck them
on the boughs where they turned into red candles.
All red and silver was this loveliest of Christmas
trees!</p>

<p>When it was finished, there was a momentary
thrill, and they all cried "Ah!" in tones of
wonder.</p>

<p>Then Hansi noticed that a noble herd of deer
had approached; the gentle creatures were looking
on with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>The woodbirds came flying from all directions,
and sang as if it were summer.</p>

<p>"Dear little men, I think I really ought to be
going home," said Hansi anxiously.</p>

<p>"Come along then," said Himself. "<i>You</i>
must go back along the high road as you came;
we are going to play hide-and-seek; but don't be
afraid, you shall have your tree all right, even if
it disappears sometimes."</p>

<p>They now marched along in the homeward
direction; but as soon as they came to the road
leading out of the woods they vanished without a
word of leave-taking. However, Hansi had not
gone far down the road, when she saw a Christmas
tree that appeared to be walking by itself across
the fields. Other people noticed it too, from the
road, and thought how queer it looked. "But
<i>of course</i>, there is someone behind carrying it,"
they said to themselves, and thought no more of
the matter. People expect the usual before the
unusual, naturally enough, and yet sometimes
the unusual is the most probable, as in this
case.</p>

<p>Hansi was late for dinner, and had a fine scolding.</p>

<p>"At all events, I suppose you have done your
lessons," said her mother.</p>

<p>"No, mother, I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Well, I never, playing again, I suppose?
Now, what <i>can</i> be the use of playing, I should
like to know?"</p>

<p>This was an exceptionally stupid question; for
most people know that little folk cannot grow
mentally without play, any more than flowers can
grow without sunshine. "All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy," is not only a proverb, but
it is true as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve. Hansi trembled with
excitement. "What's the use of getting so
lively, Hansi?" said her big brother Paul despondently.
"You know quite well that we are not
to have any tree this year. I shall get a new pair
of boots, and you a pinafore; these we should have
to have anyway. That's not what I call a merry
Christmas."</p>

<p>"But the bells are ringing, don't you hear
them? and don't you think you can see just a
glimmer of silver through the door?" said Hansi.</p>

<p>The children looked&mdash;well, really, perhaps there
was a tree there after all.</p>

<p>Just then their father came in tired, but jolly.
"Is everything ready? It is late, I have been
detained so long," he said. "Can we go in at
once?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got a tree this year," whispered
his wife in an anxious voice. "I thought we
couldn't afford it. What's the use of a Christmas
tree? We can spend our money in a more practical
way!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense. No Christmas tree! but of
course you are joking," said her husband. "I
will slip in, and light the candles." And with
these words he disappeared into the inner room,
now so mysterious to the waiting children.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Herzchen nearly began to cry. If only
she had not been so silly! Never, never would
she neglect to get a tree again! She ought to have
considered other people's prejudices, and Christmas&mdash;O
well, Christmas only comes once a year.</p>

<p>"I've got a surprise for mother," whispered
Gretel, aged ten. "I am going to recite a Christmas
poem." "And I am going to tell the Christmas
story from the Bible," said Hansi. "I have
made a letter-box for father," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! the bells are ringing&mdash;don't you
hear them across the snow?" the children whispered
to one another. "But what is that other
bell, so soft, so musical and clear!" "That is
the summons for us all to enter," said Paul.</p>

<p>The door flew open, and there stood the most
lovely Christmas tree they had ever seen or imagined,
all dazzling with silver; silver cones, silver
fish, silver nuts and acorns, and red candles, and
over all an exquisitely spun cobweb of frost.
"That's my surprise for you all," said Hansi,
who could hardly contain herself for joy. "I
found the tree, and the dear, darling Heinzelmen
brought it home for me."</p>

<p>Mrs Herzchen was speechless with astonishment,
and her husband not less so. "How very extravagant,"
they said, "but how elegant and beautiful!
Who can have given it to us?"</p>

<p>But now the children began to sing the sweet
German carol sung in every house on Christmas
Eve: "O peaceful night, O holy night," and then,
in her earnest, childish way, Hansi told the story
of the birth of the Christ-child in the Manger of
Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Gretel then stood up eagerly to recite the carol
she had learnt at school.</p>

<p>A glow of warmth and happiness illumined the
whole family, and they felt nearer to one another
than ever before. The tears actually came into
their mother's eyes, when she realised that they
had so nearly missed this moment of supreme joy.</p>

<p>She felt a little ashamed of her presents, and
for once in a way suspected herself of having been
<i>too</i> sensible. "We are not so very poor after
all," she thought. "I might have bought a few
toys that would have delighted the children's
hearts, and not have cost much money. But now
it is too late!"</p>

<p>But to her surprise, she did not see her presents
at all. For each child there was a gingerbread
cake with his or her name on it, and then the
most lovely surprises&mdash;a beautiful doll for Hansi
with real eyelashes, fretwork tools for Paul, a
doll's kitchen for Gretel, and so on. For every
one of the family there was some delightful gift.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, dear Heinzelmen,"
said Hansi, clasping her hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p>There was a big paper parcel addressed to
Mrs Herzchen in a very queer handwriting. She
opened it with much excitement, thinking it would
contain a silk dress, at least. But lo and behold,
all the presents that she had intended for her
children, tied together with red tape and a card
between, on which this verse was written:</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left"><span class="ind1">For little folk</span></td></tr>

<tr><td align="right"><span class="ind3"><i>Signed</i></span> <span class="smallcaps">Himself!</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>How the children laughed! and even Mrs
Herzchen laughed too, though she felt silly and a
little disappointed. "It is all very well to play
tricks on me," she said. "Just look at the
M&uuml;ller children next door. They have plenty of
toys and are always sucking sweets; but they
never have comfortable, warm clothes on, and
they look half fed."</p>

<p>"Of course, mother, you are right," said the
children, "and you were really joking about the
tree. We have never had one <i>half</i> so lovely!"</p>

<p>Mrs Herzchen felt rather embarrassed at this
praise. She called her husband's attention to the
things on the tree. "They can't be made of
chocolate," she said, trying to bite off the corner
of a fir cone. It was quite hard. "I do believe
they are all solid silver!" she said.</p>

<p>On closer examination, they found a little lion
imprinted on each which proved them without
doubt to be of real silver.</p>

<p>"I shall sell them at once, or they may vanish
away," she said.</p>

<p>"I should strongly advise you not to do so,"
her husband replied, and the children said, "Oh
Mother, do let us keep them always, they are so
beautiful?"</p>

<p>"But of what use are they?" said the incorrigible
mother who, you see, was not yet quite cured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the story was noised abroad that
Hansi had found a treasure in the forest.</p>

<p>The very next day, Christmas Day, as they were
eating their goose, stuffed with apples, there was
a ring at the bell&mdash;in walked a very pompous
Prussian policeman with fierce moustaches.</p>

<p>"Mrs Herzchen here?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> want?" asked that lady, much
indignant at being disturbed during her Christmas
dinner.</p>

<p>"Young person answering to the name of Hansi
Herzchen here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Please, sir, that's me," said Hansi,
rising and curtsying, and growing very red.</p>

<p>The policeman produced a paper in which he
entered all sorts of memoranda.</p>

<p>"<i>Age and date of birth?</i>" he demanded of
Hansi.</p>

<p>"Seven years old, <i>of course</i>," answered Hansi.
"My birthday is on February 27th, if you want
to know. It was on a Sunday last year."</p>

<p>"That's beside the question." He looked
severe.</p>

<p>"February 27th, 1897," said Hansi, prompted
by her mother.</p>

<p><i>Residence&mdash;temporary or otherwise &mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p><i>Baptism &mdash;&mdash; date of &mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p><i>Vaccinated &mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>All these facts Hansi's mother supplied at once.
They are so constantly demanded in Germany
that she had them always ready at hand, tied up
in seven different packets for each child.</p>

<p><i>Married or single?</i></p>

<p>Here Hansi giggled, and he entered solemnly
the word "<i>spinster</i>."</p>

<p>"Is that something <i>horrid</i>?" asked Hansi
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, it only means unmarried," said Paul
laughing. "<i>What</i> a fool he is!"</p>

<p><i>Occupation?</i></p>

<p>"Please sir, I go to school and learn my lessons,
but I play a good deal too."</p>

<p>"We will write 'spinster,'" he said, frowning
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me, child, if you do not wish
to go to prison." The whole family shuddered
with horror.</p>

<p>"Take all those silver things off the tree. They
are 'found treasure,' and belong to the State.
You ought to have declared them at once, and
saved me all this trouble," he said.</p>

<p>Hansi began to cry.</p>

<p>Mrs Herzchen was very angry, "Why don't
you mind your own business?" she said. "These
things are our property. You will come and
demand the clothes off our backs next."</p>

<p>"Be thankful that I do not accuse you of
<i>stealing</i> these valuables," answered the fellow in
a terrible voice.</p>

<p>"But are you sure they are not chocolate
after all?" he said. "They look remarkably
like it, covered with silver paper, you
know."</p>

<p>He examined them carefully and ejaculating,
"Well, I never," tossed them all into a leather
wallet that he had brought with him.</p>

<p>Mrs Herzchen poured forth such a storm of
abuse, that he threatened her with an action for
libel; but she literally turned him out of doors.
Her parting words were: "Get out! Go along
and make a fool of yourself if you like."</p>

<p>Some days afterwards, the man took his treasures
to the office and gave them up with a self-important
flourish, only to be laughed at for his
pains. The cones were just common, ordinary
fir cones, and the silver fish had turned into little
dead trout, smelling very unpleasant.</p>

<p>He chucked them all away in the street, and
this was an episode in his dignified career that
he did not like to be reminded of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Hansi's mother still always preferred
useful things to artistic and ornamental ones,
still she realised that the useful and ornamental
may often be combined, and as she dearly loved
her children, and saved up money merely on their
account, she determined that they should have a
merry Christmas every year, without any special
help from the kind little Heinzelmen.</p>

<p>And did Hansi give the cake to her dwarf
friends as she had promised to do? Why, of
course, she did. The children went all together
to the forest on New Year's Eve, and found the
actual spot where the tree had stood. They placed
a large piece of cake on the old stump. But they
did not see the Heinzelmen or even the squirrel,
although they repeated seven times seven is forty-nine
in the hope of attracting them.</p>

<p>Now a dear little Heinzelman, whom I met out
for a walk, told me this story "himself"; but he
vanished at this point, and so must I. I wish
Hansi and all her brothers and sisters a very
merry Christmas, and so, I am sure, do you.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ENGINEER_AND_THE" id="THE_ENGINEER_AND_THE"></a>THE ENGINEER AND THE DWARFS</h2>

<p>A tunnel had been dug through a crag which
had hitherto been considered as a serious obstacle
in the railway route; the light now shone through
at the farther end. There was a shout of joy
from the tired workmen. The air had been
stifling in the tunnel; the work was hard and
dangerous; several men had been killed in detaching
portions of rock that had been loosened
by dynamite. It was a great relief to have got
through. Now the walls would have to be made
smooth with cement&mdash;indeed the men had already
begun this work at the other end&mdash;and the tunnel
tested for greater security. Then the express
train could run through directly, instead of
being obliged to shunt backwards and forwards
in a way that made it very uncomfortable for
people who did not like sitting with their backs
to the engine.</p>

<p>The young engineer, Karl Hammerstein, who
had been supervising the men's work, was glad
enough to find himself in the fresh air. His head
ached violently, the oppression of the atmosphere
had well-nigh overpowered him.</p>

<p>The mountain was clothed on this side with
tall forest trees; the drooping firs offered an
inviting shade. It was seven o'clock in the
evening, the men were packing up their tools to
go home. They would be obliged to march back
through the tunnel; for there was no way round,
except through the wildest forest with a tangled
undergrowth of brambles and ferns. But they
had their lamps, and did not mind the tunnel;
it was familiar enough to them, who had worked
in it for months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Karl, who was dead-beat, stretched
himself out under the trees, covered himself with
his cloak, and fell fast asleep, meaning only to
rest a minute or two, before he also set off home.</p>

<p>It was late when he awoke; the full moon was
shining. He felt quite dazed. Where could he be?</p>

<p>He had slept in many queer little rooms when
he was travelling; but they always had a window
and a door. Where was the window? Ugh&mdash;he
shivered&mdash;it was cold. Then an unreasoning
terror took hold of him: he was only half-awake
as yet. What could that dreadful gap be in the
wall of his room, blacker than the darkness?
Surely it was a bogey hole leading down to the
bottomless pit? The next minute he laughed at
his fears, as we usually do when we come safely
out of nightmare land and feel the earth&mdash;or bed
beneath us again.</p>

<p>He saw that it was the mouth of the tunnel,
and glancing up he saw the giant fir-tree under
which he had been sleeping with outstretched
arms above him in the light of the moon.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I never! what a dunderhead I am!"
he said to himself&mdash;"fancy sleeping like that,
why such a thing has never happened to me
before! I had meant to go to have supper and
stay the night at the new hotel in Elm. I have
heard the landlord's daughter is an uncommonly
pretty girl!"</p>

<p>"Heigho!" he went on, stretching himself,
"there's nothing for it, but to walk home. I
might wait a long time before a motor-car came
to pick me up here!"</p>

<p>Then he remembered with a sudden start that
there was only one possible way back to Elm,
and that was through the tunnel. It was not a
very pleasant idea to walk back alone through the
dark, oppressive tunnel at midnight; luckily he
had his lantern with him.</p>

<p>"How could I have been such an idiot!" he
muttered to himself again. He found some bread
and cheese in his pocket, which he ate with a good
appetite. His headache had gone, and he felt
much refreshed after his sleep. Then he put on
his cloak, lighted the lantern, and set out cheerfully
to walk through the tunnel.</p>

<p>He had not gone far into the black darkness,
when he thought he heard voices whispering and
talking not far away from him; then he distinctly
felt something or somebody brush past him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, who's there?" he called out. Complete
silence. He was not easily frightened; but his
heart began to beat quicker than usual. "Well,
if it's robbers or tramps, they won't find much to
rob on me," he thought; for he had only a few
shillings in his pocket for his night's lodging.</p>

<p>It was probably a bat that had strayed in at
the opening, he decided. Suddenly he came to a
standstill. Right across the way was a mass of
freshly fallen earth and rock that quite obstructed
his further progress. "Well this is a pretty fix
to be in. How aggravating!" he said to himself,
and leant for a moment against the wall of the
tunnel, to consider what would be best to do.
The wall instantly gave way, he stumbled,
bruised his arm against a sharp corner of the
rock, and his lantern went out. At the same
time he heard a sound resembling the slamming
of a door. "Donnerwetter!" he exclaimed&mdash;a
mild German swear which means literally
"thunder-weather!"&mdash;"whatever shall I do
now?" He had a box of matches in his pocket
and soon succeeded in relighting the lantern.</p>

<p>"There is nothing for it, but to go back again to
where I started from, and wait for daybreak,"
he thought.</p>

<p>By this time he had become confused, and had
lost the sense of direction; but there <i>could</i> be only
one way back. So he tramped along a long winding
passage that he took to be the excavated
tunnel. "How curious, I could have been certain
that the tunnel was much wider, and more direct
than this. Can I be still dreaming?" he thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was startled and astonished to
come on a flight of steps leading downwards.
There had certainly been no stairs in the tunnel!
He saw too that the walls were painted in a
decorative way like some of the Catacombs in
Rome; only these were far more elaborate. "I'm
in for an adventure, I must be lost in the heart
of the mountain," he thought. "Perhaps I shall
come upon a robber's cave, or gipsies may be
hiding in these rocks; it is a good thing that I
have this pretty little fellow with me," and he
touched the revolver in his breast pocket. He
then observed in front of him a faint light, other
than that of his lantern and whistled softly with
astonishment, as he saw that the way opened out
into a cave or vault. A few steps more, and he
found himself in an exquisite, though tiny hall,
with an arched ceiling supported by pillars of
red granite. The walls and ceiling were beautifully
inlaid with mosaic work in gold and
coloured stones, like the interior of St Mark's,
Venice, and seemed to be of great antiquity,
though of this he could not be certain.</p>

<p>The light was so dim that what might have
been the brilliant effect of the whole, was lost, and
the young engineer thought to himself involuntarily:
"This ought to be lit up by electric light&mdash;it
would look quite different then!" As he
was deliberating how electric light might be laid
on, a door in the wall opened, and a number of
little dwarf men trooped in. They did not see
him at first; for he was standing behind a pillar.
They settled themselves down on benches that
were arranged in a semicircle, and one of them
with an important air mounted a raised dais
facing them. He was just beginning to speak with
the words: "Gentlemen of the Committee," when
they caught sight of the stranger standing in the
centre of the hall, lantern in hand. They gave a
cry of alarm, and were just going to scuttle away
like frightened rabbits, when Karl called out,
"Hi&mdash;Ho there&mdash;Gentlemen of the Committee&mdash;good
Sirs&mdash;don't run away. I won't harm you&mdash;<i>Christmas
Tree</i>."</p>

<p>Now Christmas Tree is the most solemn oath
among the dwarfs&mdash;it is equivalent to swearing
on the Bible with us. How Karl knew this, he
did not know; it came to him on the inspiration
of the minute. Perhaps his grandmother had
told him stories in his childhood about the dwarf
men, in which it occurred.</p>

<p>It had an instantaneous effect on the dwarfs
who stood still at once. "But you are one of the
bad men who are building the tunnel," they cried
out. "Aha&mdash;we can spoil your little game, my
good fellow, we can smash you and your snorting
old dragon who is coming here to devour us, into
pieces. We can throw rocks on the line&mdash;Aha!"</p>

<p>"We have often watched you&mdash;though you
were not aware of our presence," said the chairman.
"We had just called a committee meeting
to decide what is to be done about this matter
of the tunnel."</p>

<p>"Now you know it is all nonsense about the
dragon," said Karl persuasively, as if he were
talking to children. "You have heard of trains,
haven't you? You are not so behind the times as
all that!"</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> of us have seen the dragon and even
ridden in him," said Mr Chairman. "There is
a famous story about that; but the majority still
look upon the railway with suspicion and even
distrust. We only ask to be let alone, and not
be interfered with by meddling mortals," he said
in a gruff voice. "What do we need with you?
Our civilization and our history are more ancient
even than that of India or Egypt, and from us
the human race is descended."</p>

<p>"I tell you what," said Karl, "I could put
you up to a thing or two for all that. We live
in Modern Europe, you know, and not in ancient
Egypt. Now, for instance, why is this beautiful
hall, a perfect work of art in its way, so badly
illuminated!"</p>

<p>"Badly illuminated! Why, what do you
mean?" cried the little men indignantly. "Do
you not see our glow-worms hanging in festoons
on the walls?"</p>

<p>"O, I say, <i>glow-worms</i>! in the twentieth
century, that's rather strong, you know! what
you want, is electric light."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said the dwarfs curiously.</p>

<p>"You have only to press a little button on the
wall, like this," he pressed his thumb on the
wall&mdash;"and the whole place is lit up almost as if
it were day."</p>

<p>"We don't believe it&mdash;we don't believe it,"
said the little men.</p>

<p>"But it's true, I assure you, <i>Christmas Tree</i>,"
said Karl.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it make our eyes blink?" said one
thin little fellow.</p>

<p>Karl noticed that the dwarfs' eyes were small
and their faces pale. Most of them had quite
white beards and hair.</p>

<p>"That comes of living so long underground,
it is a loss of pigment," thought Karl. "Like a
geranium that has been kept in the cellar! Now
I could fix it up for you," said the young
engineer, always keenly on the look-out for a job.
"We are going to have it laid on in the tunnel."</p>

<p>"How much would it cost?" inquired the
dwarfs.</p>

<p>"O, a thousand pounds or so!" said Karl
carelessly. He had heard that dwarfs were very
rich, and he was a good man of business, and
had his eyes open to his interests.</p>

<p>"That's a great deal of money, a great deal
of money!" said the little men in chorus.</p>

<p>"O, as for that I am sure we could come to
an agreement," said Karl. "By the way," he
went on&mdash;"do you happen to have a telephone
here? I should like to 'phone to a friend of
mine and tell him where I am. It would be such
a joke."</p>

<p>"What's a telephone?" asked the dwarfs.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a telephone is! Himmel!
you <i>are</i> old-fashioned down here&mdash;you are
only half civilised!"</p>

<p>"Half civilised, half civilised!" repeated the
dwarfs angrily, "let us repeat our civilisation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what a telephone is," said Karl,
interrupting this burst of eloquence. "It is a
little tube connected with a wire, you put one
part of it to your ear, and then you put your
mouth to the tube and say: 'No. 1280,' and then
listen, and your friend will speak to you from
miles and miles away, and you can answer him."</p>

<p>"We don't believe it, we don't believe it!"
said the unbelieving dwarfs.</p>

<p>"It's true for all that, <i>Christmas Tree</i>," said
Karl. "I could fix that up for you too, if you
have any connection with the outer air. You
must have," he continued, sniffing, "for the air
is nice and fresh here, quite different to that in
the tunnel. Have you a ventilating shaft?"</p>

<p>"O yes," said the little men, "we can show
you that!" And they led him out of the hall.
In the passage outside was a great cleft or crevice
in the rocks such as we call in England a chine.
Above it the moon shone full and bright. A
waterfall rushed down on one side; he saw ferns
and dear little plants leaning over the water,
growing between the cracks of the rocks. There
were also glow-worms cunningly arranged in
groups that looked like fairy stars. On the other
side, he observed to his joy rough steps leading
upwards cut in the solid rock. He sighed a sigh
of relief, here at least was the way out.</p>

<p>He regarded the pretty sight with the eye of
the professional engineer, rather than that of the
artist. "That must be a stiff climb for you little
men up there," he said. "Now if you had a
lift!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the dwarfs eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's a little room that goes up and down when
you pull a wire rope."</p>

<p>"We don't believe it, we don't believe it,"
said the sceptical gnomes again.</p>

<p>"It's true nevertheless; now wouldn't it be fun
to have a ride in it? I could fix that up too, you
know, if you gave me time and helped a bit
yourselves," said Karl.</p>

<p>"Really you poor things," he went on, "You
do not seem to have heard much of modern technical
progress down here in this rabbit-burrow.
I beg your pardon I'm sure"&mdash;as they looked
displeased again&mdash;"Now I am really curious
to know&mdash;have you heard of Zeppelin?"</p>

<p>"Zeppelin, no!&mdash;is he the King of Germany?"
said the dwarf who had been in the chair.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!&mdash;King of Germany&mdash;well he <i>is</i>
nearly, in some people's eyes," said Karl. "He
has built an airship; it is the most wonderful of
all new inventions, it floats in the air like a boat
does in the water."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">he went on in an enthusiastic way. "You can go
for a ride in it any day in Frankfurt, providing
the weather is fine and you can afford to pay
&pound;15!"</p>

<p>"Just listen to him, just listen to him!" said
the dwarfs. "We don't believe a word you have
said. You are imposing on our credulity, you bad
man," and thereupon they flew at him and began
to beat him with their clubs, which were heavily
weighted, and to pinch him with their long fingers.</p>

<p>It might have gone hardly with him, but quick
as thought Karl flashed out the little revolver
from his pocket. They seemed to know the
meaning of that modern toy; for they crouched
back trembling, and not daring to move.</p>

<p>"Now stop it, will you," he said, "or I shall
have to shoot you, and take you home with me
to be stuffed or put into the National Anthropological
Museum. They would give me a good
price for you," he said musingly&mdash;"they would
think you were The Missing Link."</p>

<p>"O please, Mr Hammerstein, don't shoot us&mdash;("however
did the little chaps find out my name!"
thought Karl) we will believe all you say, even
if it seems the greatest nonsense to us. After all
birds fly, bats fly and fairies fly, why should
not ships and trains fly?" said the spokesman,
who, I must tell you, was a relation of King
Reinhold in the Taunus Mountains and was
proud of belonging to a royal family.</p>

<p>Karl called him Mr Query, because he was so
fond of asking questions, but so slow to take in
a new fact, as indeed were all the dwarfs.</p>

<p>"You promised us <i>Christmas Tree</i> not to harm
us," said Mr Query, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't hurt anyone, did I, but how
about your treatment of me? That wasn't in the
contract either," said Karl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Karl looked about him curiously.
He had never been to dwarfland before, and
might never have the chance of visiting it again,
and he did not wish to lose the opportunity of
seeing all he could.</p>

<p>"Are there any more of you?" he asked the
dwarfs.</p>

<p>"I should think so," they answered. "Hundreds
and thousands of us live under this mountain."</p>

<p>Karl noticed passages running in all directions,
and low caves which seemed to be dwellings,
many of them richly ornamented and furnished.
In one of these caves he observed a looking-glass,
and wondered which of the dwarf men trimmed
his beard before it. He met a great many little
men scurrying about, who cast anxious glances
at the giant who had strayed among them. Karl
had frequently to stoop; the ceilings seemed very
low to him, although they were high enough
compared to the dwarf men.</p>

<p>"Where are the female dwarfs?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Dwarfs have no womenfolk," Mr Query replied.
"We did away with them long, long ago!"</p>

<p>"That was rather rough on them, eh?" said
Karl.</p>

<p>"Well it happened so many centuries ago that
we have forgotten all about it, and so are unable
to gratify your curiosity. Perhaps if you care
for antiquities and were to study the pictures on
the walls, you might find out."</p>

<p>"Not my line," said Karl shortly.</p>

<p>"As we have no women," Mr Query continued,
"we never quarrel and have no differences of
opinion."</p>

<p>"I expect no lady would care to live down
here with you in this dark hole," said Karl,
thoughtfully. "But to whom does the looking-glass
belong?"</p>

<p>"A fairy comes to visit us occasionally; she
makes herself useful and tidies up the place a bit
for us," said the dwarf. "She's here now&mdash;would
you like to see her?"</p>

<p>"Of course I should," said Karl, his heart
beating fast at the thought of meeting a real
fairy&mdash;perhaps she was a princess in disguise, and
he might be chosen to win her.</p>

<p>The dwarf drew back the curtain that hung
before a beautifully furnished cave, and there
Karl saw a young girl who was busy dusting and
arranging handsome gold vases on a carved
bracket. Even by the pale light of the glow-worms
and the lantern which he had not yet
extinguished, he could see that she was very
beautiful. She had a mass of red-brown hair,
that waved in tiny curls about her forehead, and
hazel eyes with dark eyelashes. As to her figure,
she was small and slight, so that she did not look
quite so monstrous in that little world as Karl
did. She had a big holland apron on, with a
gaily embroidered border. When she saw Karl,
she laughed. "To think of meeting a young
man in this old hole&mdash;how funny," she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Are you a fairy?" said Karl, bewildered by
her beauty.</p>

<p>"Do I look like one?" she answered with a
toss of her bronze curls.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said Karl, "but then I have
never seen a fairy; you are pretty enough for
one!"</p>

<p>She made a little curtsy in acknowledgment
of the compliment. "I'll have finished my work
soon," she said, "and then we will go home
together."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful," said Karl.</p>

<p>The dwarfs were looking on.</p>

<p>"You may go," said Mr Query. "You have
worked enough for to-day." He handed her
several pieces of gold. Her eyes sparkled with
glee as she pocketed the coins; she was proud of
having earned some money.</p>

<p>"Follow me," she said to Karl, "and I will
show you the way home. You would never be
able to find it alone."</p>

<p>"The dwarfs have burrowed here like moles,"
said Karl aside to the girl, "and I believe they
are almost as blind and ignorant."</p>

<p>"Do not speak disrespectfully of moles," said
a dwarf who had overheard the last part of this
remark. "They belong to the most intelligent of
all creatures; who can build a fortress like the
mole?"</p>

<p>"Norah," said the dwarfs, "Norah, when
are you coming again?"</p>

<p>"Very soon," she said, "I'll bring some metal
polish with me, and make your vases shine!"</p>

<p>"Norah," thought Karl, "so that is her name.
I wonder where she lives?"</p>

<p>Norah led the way back through intricate
passages until they came to the open space where
there was the staircase leading up to the outside
world. "Good morning," she said to the dwarfs.</p>

<p>Karl pulled out his watch&mdash;yes&mdash;the night was
already past, it was four o'clock.</p>

<p>"I'll drop in again soon, and see about your
little commissions," he said to the dwarfs.
"Electric light you want, telephone and lift,
it will be rather a big job."</p>

<p>"And what about the airship?" asked Mr
Query.</p>

<p>"O I can't rig that up for you; you must go
to Frankfurt and see that for yourselves. Good
morning," and he turned to follow Norah, who
was already some way up the stone staircase.
From a distance she really looked like a fairy.
The light of dawn shone on her wonderful hair;
she had taken off her apron, and had on a white
dress trimmed with gold, that fluttered as she
mounted the steps. At the top she waited to take
breath, and Karl easily caught her up. They
gazed down into the depths beneath them, but no
trace of dwarfland could they see. Even the
glow-worms had vanished, and the rough steps
looked like natural niches in the rock. They
were on the top of the mountain. Near by stood
a grove of firs, the trees were so gnarled and
stunted from their exposed position that they
looked like a dwarf forest, and seemed appropriate
growing there.</p>

<p>"Your name is 'Norah'," said Karl boldly,
"but that is all I know about you!"</p>

<p>"I am no fairy princess, alas," said Norah,
"but only a poor landlord's daughter. My father
and I have the new hotel in Elm!"</p>

<p>"O you must be the pretty innkeeper's daughter
then of whom I have heard so much," said Karl.
"Now isn't it funny, I had meant to stay the
night at your hotel on the chance of seeing you,
and now we meet under the earth in dwarfland&mdash;romantic
I call that! Why do you work for
those little beggars?" he continued.</p>

<p>"For the same reason that you have proposed
doing so," she answered, "to earn money. I
was picking bilberries on the mountains and
strayed into their land by chance one day. I
found them busy at work spring cleaning, and
helped them a bit, and that was my first introduction
to the dwarfs. They pay me well for little
work, and starting an hotel costs a great deal of
money you must know. I am glad to be able to
help my father."</p>

<p>"You do not come from this part of Germany,
you speak quite differently to us," said the young
man inquiringly.</p>

<p>"My home is over the seas," said Norah. "My
father is an Irishman; but we found it hard to
get on there, and meant to emigrate to America.
Then father changed his mind, and we came to
Germany. My mother died some years ago,"
she said sadly.</p>

<p>"Poor child," said Karl in a deep, sympathetic
voice, "there must be a good deal of responsibility
on your young shoulders."</p>

<p>"I should just think so," said Norah with a
sigh, "but our hotel is going to be a tremendous
success!" As she spoke, she led the way through
a little narrow path, that crossed a heath where
heather grew, and great masses of yellow starred
ragwort. "Ah! me beloved golden flower," she
cried, pointing the plant out to Karl, who had
passed it by a thousand times as a common weed,
but to whom it seemed from this day forth to be
alive and full of meaning. "We call it fairy-horses
in Ireland," she said, with a rapt look on
her face, "sure and I can see my native mountains
when I pluck it"&mdash;and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>She wanted no consoling however, her mood
changed quickly enough. "Do come here," she
called out to Karl, "and see what I've found
now!" She showed him a clump of pure white
heather; "it is tremendously lucky," she said,
"and you shall have a bit too." So saying she
stuck a piece of white heather in his buttonhole&mdash;real
white heather, not the faded flowers which
children sometimes mistake for it. Karl treasured
the spray carefully.</p>

<p>"And how did you come to be among the
dwarfs?" said Norah. But their further conversation
was checked by a little brook that ran
straight across the path. Now Norah usually
took off her shoes and stockings and waded over
this stream; but she did not like to do so with
Karl looking on. Karl would have liked to pick
her up in his arms and carry her across like a
true hero of romance; but he was shy of proposing
it. So he fetched some large flat stones,
placed them dexterously in the stream, and
sprang across himself, then he held out a hand
to Norah who stepped over as quickly and gracefully
as a young deer.</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you how it was you found
me in dwarfland," said Karl as they walked
on together. "I was at work on the new
tunnel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll not be telling me that you are a
working man?" said Norah.</p>

<p>"No I am an engineer. I was on duty looking
after the men, then, somehow or other I fell
against the wall of the tunnel and hurt my arm";
he showed her his torn coat as a proof of the
story.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," she interrupted, "did you
bind it up properly?"</p>

<p>"O, it was a mere nothing," said Karl. "Well&mdash;I
found myself in a strange winding passage
that led right down into the central hall of the
dwarfs." He did not wish to say that he had
been asleep; he thought that would sound so silly.
"Queer little fellows they are, those dwarfs,"
he continued, "awfully ignorant too. Now will
you believe it they had never heard of the
Zeppelin airship?"</p>

<p>"We'll really have to give them lessons,"
said Norah, laughing, "but perhaps they are not
so stupid as they make themselves out to be!"</p>

<p>Climbing over boulders and stones, laughing
and talking the while like two children just out
of school, they reached the bottom of the mountain
and saw the village. It could hardly be
called a town as yet, though Norah's father hoped
that the new railway station would speedily
convert it into one.</p>

<p>"Do you know where our hotel is?" said Norah.
"It is at the other end of the village; we will go
round through the fields; the village folk stare so;
they are up at five o'clock to do their field-work.</p>

<p>"There it is!" she called out proudly, pointing
to a large white house with green shutters
on which the words "H&ocirc;tel Fancy" were written
in large gold letters.</p>

<p>"What a queer name for an hotel!" said Karl.</p>

<p>"Yes, don't you think it is original and
attractive?" said Norah. "There are so many
hotels called H&ocirc;tel Hohenzollern'&mdash;or 'The
German Emperor' and so I thought we would
have a change."</p>

<p>"It is a splendid idea," said Karl, who was
over head and ears in love with Norah by this
time and thought that everything she did and
said, was perfect. Still, like a prudent German,
he wondered to himself if she would make a good
housewife. He knew she must be good at cleaning
or the dwarfs would hardly have employed
her, but her dainty little hands did not look like
cooking.</p>

<p>"What would it matter, if the dinner were
burnt sometimes," he thought, "if I could have
such a pretty, fascinating little girl to marry
me?"</p>

<p>"Will you come in and have some breakfast?"
said Norah as they approached H&ocirc;tel
Fancy.</p>

<p>"Rather," he said, "I must own that I am
famished. I only had a dry bit of bread and
cheese for supper, and that is a long while ago."</p>

<p>It was early still, Norah's father was not yet
up; so she set to work and lit the fire, and soon
had the water boiling for coffee. She set a fine
breakfast before him, ham and eggs and sausage
and rolls. I am bound in strict veracity to say
that love did not prevent his consuming a large
amount. He changed his mind about her cooking,
and thought that she could do everything well
and was a model of perfection.</p>

<p>"Do have some, too, yourself," he said, and
Norah soon joined him with a hearty appetite.</p>

<p>Mr O'Brian, for that was the name of Norah's
father, was astonished to find them at breakfast
when he entered the comfortably furnished
parlour.</p>

<p>"An early guest, father," said Norah. "He is
going to put up here for the present; he is an
engineer at work on the tunnel; good thing for
us"; she whispered the last sentence. "I will
see about getting your room ready," she said,
turning to Karl.</p>

<p>"Please do not trouble," said he. "I'm due
at the tunnel again at 7 a.m. and it is 6 o'clock
now. I hope to return to-night about 8 o'clock;
then I shall be glad of a room," he said, with a
hardly suppressed yawn. "Pray excuse me, I had
rather a bad night," he added with a twinkle
in his eyes that only Norah perceived.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, Norah handed some
gold pieces to her father.</p>

<p>"And do you think that I am doing right in
taking this money from you, Norah?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why of course father! I'm telling you that
it's fairy gold, and will bring us luck," she
replied.</p>

<p>The Irish have a great respect for luck and
omens; many of them still believe in the good folk,
and Mr O'Brian, who was of a very easygoing disposition,
was quite satisfied with this explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some weeks passed. Karl and Norah became
better friends every day. All Karl's previous
notions of the universe had been knocked on the
head by his visit to dwarfland. He had thought
that he knew almost everything that there was to
be known, but now he was always on the look-out
for surprises. Moreover his love for Norah had
opened his eyes. Every bush seemed ablaze with
fire, and the roses and pinks in the gardens smelt
as they had never smelt before.</p>

<p>Norah was like a fairy princess; she was not
easy to win, she loved her freedom, and wished
to call no man lord and master. Because she
was such a wild bird and of a poetic and dreamy
temperament, Karl's practical mind appealed to
her. He possessed that which she and her father
lacked. She was tired of her father's promises
and castles in the air, which usually ended in
bitter disappointment. How many guests had
they had since H&ocirc;tel Fancy had been opened?
She could almost count them on her fingers.
The peasants frequented the old inn that they
were accustomed to in the village, and very few
strangers came their way.</p>

<p>"I will play waiter on Sunday and help you,"
said Karl one Saturday evening when he had
returned from his work.</p>

<p>"Indeed and you'll not need to," said Norah
with a pretty Irish lilt in her voice, "it's not
many people that will be coming! It will be
different of course when the new station is built;
then we shall be flourishing," she continued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a fine Sunday afternoon. Karl and
Norah sat in the garden under the plane-trees
which made a chequered pattern in shadow on
the ground, and sipped glasses of Apfelwein or
cider in German fashion.</p>

<p>"It was a queer thing that we two should meet
in the little people's land. It seems as if we were
meant to pull together, doesn't it?" said Karl
with an effort.</p>

<p>Norah jumped up immediately, saying that
she must see if the water was boiling for
coffee.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Karl catching her by the
hand; "you are not going to run away like that;
you've just got to listen to me, Norah; for I can't
keep it in any longer. You are my fairy princess&mdash;I
love you with all my heart, and I want
you to promise me to be my little wife&mdash;will
you?"</p>

<p>"You don't know me yet," said Norah blushing
like a rose. "I've got a most awful temper!"</p>

<p>"I'll risk it," said Karl laughing, and they
plighted their troth under the trees in the garden
with no one but the empty chairs and tables
looking on, that were spread in anticipation of
the guests who had not arrived.</p>

<p>So Karl and Norah were engaged to be married
and were as happy as ever it is possible to be in
this world! They did not celebrate the event in
the usual ceremonious German fashion; for
Norah's friends and relations were in Ireland and
she had only a few acquaintances in Germany as
yet. Karl's mother was a widow, and lived with
her married daughter in Pomerania; so she could
not come so far south for anything less than a
wedding or a funeral.</p>

<p>Now Karl began to consider the material side
of the question. "Will the love that we are rich
in, light the fire in the kitchen, and the little god
of love turn the spit O!" What had they to live
on? He was a young man, and his income was
very small; it takes many years in Germany to
make a career as engineer, unless you are exceptionally
lucky and have influential friends.</p>

<p>H&ocirc;tel Fancy was rather like its name and did
not pay at all as yet. Now Karl had not forgotten
the dwarfs, and Norah began to miss the gold
pieces which had disappeared fast enough in the
last few weeks.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," she said, "we will go
together to dwarfland. You can arrange about
the electric light, and I will do some metal
polishing; we will meet afterwards and come
home again together, it will be splendid
fun!"</p>

<p>"How can we get there?" asked Karl somewhat
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Why, the same way as we came out&mdash;through
the rocky gap; I know the way as well as
anything, I have been there frequently," said
Norah.</p>

<p>It was early autumn; the evenings had begun
to close in. Karl had managed to get off earlier
than usual; still it was almost dusk as the two
set out to go to dwarfland. The sun was setting
and threw a wonderful golden glow over the
world that was reflected in the hearts of the young
lovers.</p>

<p>"My stones must be there still," said Karl as
they came to the little brook, "for who could
have taken them away?" Yet to his surprise
there were no stones there; neither were any to
be found in the neighbourhood. There was nothing
for it, but to carry Norah over. He did not
feel so shy and embarrassed this time, as he
picked up his little sweetheart laughing and
struggling in his arms.</p>

<p>"You are as light as a feather," he said as he
set her down again.</p>

<p>"A feather bed, you mean," she said, "and
they are a pretty fair weight. I shall never get
used to German feather beds," she continued. "I
can't even get them to look right when I make
them and shake them!"</p>

<p>"You need to be born and brought up to
them to appreciate them," he replied, "but
never mind, what does it matter, what is a
feather bed in comparison with our love?" They
laughed for pure joy and good humour as they
walked along; ah how quickly time passes when
one is so happy! The sunlight gilded the rocks
before them, till they looked as if they contained
streaks of gold ore. They crossed the little moor,
and clambered over the rocks till they reached
the stunted fir-grove.</p>

<p>Looking back they saw that the sky had
become a glowing red as it often does just before
the light dies out; seen through the dark, twisted
trees the wood appeared to be on fire. The lovers
sat down and gazed for a few moments in silence
till the glory faded from the sky.</p>

<p>"Now for it, Norah," said Karl getting up and
offering her a hand, "the way down into dwarfland
must be quite near here!"</p>

<p>"Of course I know, I can find it at once," she
answered.</p>

<p>They searched carefully around for the great
crack in the rocks, but could find nothing in the
least resembling it.</p>

<p>"How absurd; how <i>can</i> we miss it when it is
certainly not more than a yard or two away,"
said Norah.</p>

<p>"The steps were not so easily recognisable, if
I remember rightly," said Karl, "but we are
sure to find them in a minute."</p>

<p>It grew darker and darker; the mountain was
covered with boulders of stone, juniper bushes
and stunted trees; but no trace of the great rent
in the mountain-side could they discover.</p>

<p>"Did we dream it all?" said Karl.</p>

<p>"Impossible, why I have been down there
many times," said Norah beginning to feel
bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p>"Supposing I were to fetch some of my men
here and blow up the rocks with dynamite; we
must be able to get in then, for the mountain
is as full of dwarfs as bees in a hive," said Karl,
who was getting in a temper.</p>

<p>"And do you think they would reward you
handsomely for your services," said Norah sarcastically,
"and O the poor little men, they
always treated me with the utmost kindness and
politeness, and gave me far more money than ever
I bargained for!"</p>

<p>"They nearly pinched me black and blue,
till I frightened them with my revolver," said
Karl.</p>

<p>"The wretches!" said Norah, "but why?"</p>

<p>"Because I was silly enough to tell them about
the airship, and they thought I was humbugging
them."</p>

<p>"How absurd!" Norah exclaimed. "But
what are we to do now, Karl?" she continued in
a doleful voice. "I <i>must</i> have some money; we
are still in debt for the greater part of our
furniture; and the house is heavily mortgaged."</p>

<p>"If I could only get a good post!" said Karl
sighing deeply. "I had reckoned on those dwarf
chaps!"</p>

<p>"We shall never be able to marry," said Norah,
now in the depths of despair; "our house will
have to be given up, and our things sold by
auction, and I, O I shall have to marry a
horrid, rich old peasant who will treat me as
a servant, and father will be obliged to work
in the fields." With this she burst into tears.</p>

<p>It was quite dark now save for the new moon
whose pale crescent shone in the sky. Norah
observed it in spite of her tears.</p>

<p>"The new moon!" she exclaimed. "O do let
us turn all the money that we have in our
pockets. How much have you got Karl?"</p>

<p>"About 10 shillings," he replied.</p>

<p>"O you are richer than I am; I have only 8d.
in my purse; nevertheless let us turn what we
have, and it will be sure to bring us a fortune."</p>

<p>Karl laughed. "You little fairy," he said,
and looked at her with admiration; then involuntarily
his eyes strayed in the direction of the fir-grove.
He thought he could see something
moving there. Norah looked too. "Karl," she
said excitedly, "I do believe it is the dwarf men
after all; who else could it be?"</p>

<p>At the same moment they caught sight of a
queer form with a turned-up nose and peaked cap
clearly outlined against the sky, and recognised
Mr Query.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Karl.</p>

<p>"[text missing in original]
to you," he said in a droll manner.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr Dwarf," said Karl, anxious to
proceed to business, "what about our little agreement
as to electric light, etc.?"</p>

<p>"The committee has decided against it,"
said Mr Query emphatically. "What do we
want with your new-fangled inventions; you
would bring your workmen with you; they would
discover our treasures, and turn the whole place
into a mine, and of course we should be obliged
to decamp."</p>

<p>"Well, there is something in what you say,"
said Karl to whom this idea had already occurred,
"but we could avoid that catastrophe!"</p>

<p>"As for you," continued the dwarf turning
to Norah, "we have discovered that you are a
human being also, and no fairy; therefore we
shall not require your services any longer."</p>

<p>"What a horrid way to give me notice, as if
I could help not being a fairy!" said poor Norah
weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>The little fellow was much distressed; he could
not make out what was the matter with her.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little Fr&auml;uleinchen," he said, "I
am sure we never thought you were so fond of us
as all that; it is very gratifying, but it is too late
now to alter our decision; the way down into
our kingdom is sealed for ever!"</p>

<p>"I could soon open it again," said Karl wrathfully.</p>

<p>"As for that, it would not be quite such an
easy matter as you think," said Mr Query mockingly.
"However we are willing to offer you
terms," he continued, "if you will leave us alone
and protect our secrets."</p>

<p>"What terms?" said Karl and Norah
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You shall see," said the dwarf, "follow me
to the fir-trees." So saying he sprang down from
the stone on which he had been sitting and came
up and shook hands with them.</p>

<p>"We are going to be married! what do you
think of that?" they informed him.</p>

<p>"Humph! Your taste, not mine," said Mr
Query. "However Norah will be able to clean
your gold and silver dishes capitally; that's a
comfort for you."</p>

<p>"We haven't got any gold and silver dishes
to clean, alas!" said Norah.</p>

<p>"Poor things," said Mr Query, "well we'll
see." He proceeded to the fir-trees where the
Gentlemen of the Committee were again assembled,
standing in a solemn semicircle. "If you will
sign this contract, we are willing to give you a
reward. I speak in the name of the Gentlemen
of the Committee," said Mr Query, and the little
men nodded their heads in assent. He drew out
a roll of parchment from a bag he carried with
him and handed it to Karl. Norah looked over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>On the parchment was written the following:</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">We,</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">pledge our solemn oath <i>Christmas Tree</i>, that we will
not attempt to visit dwarfland again, or molest the
dwarfs in any way, by offering them modern inventions
for which they have no use, etc., etc., or by
revealing their secret chambers to the glaring light
of day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Signed</i>..............................<br />
..............................</p>

<p>"We are willing enough to sign," said Karl,
"but what are your terms, old man; we want to
know that first. You offered us a bribe, you
know."</p>

<p>"All in good time," said Mr Query. "Gentlemen
of the Committee, display the treasure!"
The dwarf men formed themselves into a ring,
in the centre of which Norah and Karl could see
masses of what looked like solid gold. "You may
take as much of this as you like," they said, "and
we warrant you on our solemn word of honour
<i>Christmas Tree</i> that it is pure, unalloyed gold."</p>

<p>"We'll sign anything you like, dear little
men," said Norah, joyfully, "and I invite you
all to my wedding!"</p>

<p>"Three weeks from to-day," said Karl.</p>

<p>But Norah was too excited to notice what he
was saying.</p>

<p>"I shall always believe in the new moon,"
she repeated again and again. "How shall we
carry it?" she exclaimed suddenly. "I have
not even got a basket with me."</p>

<p>"My men shall trundle it along for you in
wheelbarrows," said Mr Query. "No please, do
not say 'thank you.' I have a great objection
to being thanked."</p>

<p>Karl and Norah now signed the document with
joyful hearts. Norah professed herself very sorry
not to see her dwarf friends again. She had a
real affection for the droll little men.</p>

<p>"You may come across us sometime again,
who knows," said Mr Query. "We make excursions
into your world from time to time. It
is improbable but not impossible that we may
meet again. Good-bye!" A brilliant flash as
of lightning shot from under the ground; the
earth trembled and shook. Norah clung to Karl
in terror; for she thought that the earth would
swallow them up too. Then Mr Query and the
dwarfs disappeared underground calling out as
they did so: "You see we have our lift and our
electric light too, Mr Engineer&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;we
are not quite so behind the times as you thought
us&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Norah and Karl stood still in speechless
astonishment; then they looked anxiously for
their gold, fearing that the dwarfs might have
played them a trick after all. But no, there were
two jolly strong-looking little fellows with wheelbarrows.
"We've got the gold all right," they
said. "Don't you be afraid. We've put some
dirty old potatoes at the top," they continued
with a cunning expression on their faces, "just
in case we meet anyone on the way you know&mdash;we
should have to hop skip and jump&mdash;one, two,
three and off, and it might look awkward for you."</p>

<p>"I am sure it's very kind of you," said Norah,
"and we can never thank you enough," and off
they all set down the mountain. It was a troublesome
job to get the heavy wheelbarrow over the
stream. Norah declared afterwards that some of
the gold was lost there; but they found no trace
of it again if it were so. They did not feel safe
until they reached the gate of H&ocirc;tel Fancy.</p>

<p>"Shall we put it in the back yard or in the
stable?" said the little fellows in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>"Put it in the corner of the stable," said
Norah, "as we have not got a horse no one
goes in there. We will manage the rest, <i>thank
you</i> so much."</p>

<p>"<i>Please</i> don't thank us," said the little men,
"dwarfs are not used to that, and it hurts their
feelings."</p>

<p>"Well, here is something for your labours,"
said Karl, and he gave the little men a handful
of silver. They turned it over and over and
seemed to regard it as a great curiosity. Then
they heard a movement in the house, and quick
as lightning they were off before Karl and Norah
could say good-bye.</p>

<p>Mr O'Brian was pacing up and down in a
great state of agitation; it was nearly midnight
and he feared they might have met with an
accident. "There's no depending on the fairies,"
he said to himself, "and dwarfs are said to be
treacherous," so you see he knew something of
what Norah was up to.</p>

<p>His joy was the greater when Norah and Karl
rushed in and dragging him to the stables showed
him the pile of gold. "I'll be for taking it to
the bank at once," he said, "you never know
but what it may melt away, or turn into a heap
of leaves, I've read stories like that."</p>

<p>"Our wedding shall be next week," said Karl,
joyfully.</p>

<p>"And aren't you going to give me any time
to get my trousseau?" said Norah with a dancing
light in her eyes that made her look more
enchanting than ever. "Sure and I'll be wanting
the finest trousseau that ever a princess had."</p>

<p>"We'll turn H&ocirc;tel Fancy into a palace," said
Mr O'Brian.</p>

<p>The wedding was celebrated three weeks from
this date, as they had agreed. Norah wore an
exquisitely soft cream silk gown, embroidered
with real gold; it was said that the embroidery
was a present from the dwarfs. Certain it is too
that she wore an old pearl necklace of such
marvellous workmanship that the like was never
seen before.</p>

<p>The tale was whispered that a little deformed
man had been seen to slip a parcel containing the
necklace into the letter-box.</p>

<p>Norah's relations came over from Ireland to
be present at the wedding, and you may be sure
that Karl's mother arrived too all the way from
Pomerania to share the festivities and the cake.
H&ocirc;tel Fancy was crammed with guests; every
available room was occupied; there was some talk
already of enlarging the house.</p>

<p>One of the presents that the bride had from her
husband, was a looking-glass, set with precious
stones. People thought that it was a curious
wedding-present, and wondered if Norah were
exceptionally vain. But Karl declared that if it
had not been for a looking-glass he might never
have known his wife, a remark which sounded
more mysterious than ever.</p>

<p>Many conjectures were made concerning it,
but none of them were half so strange as the truth.
Another present was a brooch set in diamonds in
the shape of a crescent moon.</p>

<p>As they were now wealthy, Karl was able to
indulge his passion for mechanical inventions,
and H&ocirc;tel Fancy was full of the most delightful
surprises: fountains in unexpected places in the
spray of which little balls danced up and down,
a rare gramophone that played the most soft
and pleasant music, every variety of electric light
and so on.</p>

<p>Norah was a little disappointed that her friends
the dwarfs did not come to the wedding; but what
could she expect if her mother-in-law and uncles
and aunts and cousins were all asked as well!
Could she expect that the dignified Mr Query
would condescend to become an object of general
curiosity? I have heard that the little men
called and left their cards some days after the
wedding, when Norah and Karl were away on
their honeymoon, and that Mr O'Brian treated
them as royal visitors, and that they left charmed
with his hospitality, and astounded at the many
entertaining and marvellous things that were to
be seen in H&ocirc;tel Fancy.</p>

<h2><a name="KATHCHEN_AND_THE_KOBOLD" id="KATHCHEN_AND_THE_KOBOLD"></a>K&Auml;THCHEN AND THE KOBOLD</h2>

<p>Half-way up the long steep hill that leads from
Soden to K&ouml;nigstein, a rough road branches off to
the left, plunging suddenly into a valley, and
passing through the little village of Altenhain.
As you walk down this steep rocky incline, the
Taunus Mountains rise up grand and high in
ever-changing panorama.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill lies Altenhain, an
ordinary enough Taunus village, save for the
beautiful shrine that stands on the high road.
There a Crucifix hangs between two enormous
poplar trees, one of the most beautiful natural
altars in the world. The trees are tall and pointed
like church spires, the trunks venerable with age.
May the lightning spare these grand old trees,
and the winds play gently through their boughs!</p>

<p>In this village lived a schoolmaster with his
wife and family consisting of a daughter,
twelve years old, and a baby boy. They were not
really poor; for, besides their income, they had
a piece of land to grow potatoes and vegetables;
also a strip of vineyard and fine strawberry fields
on the Dachberg, the produce of which they sold
in Frankfurt for a good price. Moreover, they
kept pigs and chickens and geese, and two dear
little goats that gave them milk.</p>

<p>On a fine September day K&auml;thchen (that was
the daughter's name) was on the Dachberg,
helping her parents to gather up the potatoes for
the winter. Two sacks stood already full, looking
from a distance like funny old peasants. K&auml;the
liked to watch the potato fires that are lit to burn
the refuse of the plants, smouldering and crackling
in the dry autumn air, and the smoke
curling up in the clear sky.</p>

<p>It was now about five o'clock, and as she had
worked all day, she was tired and began to groan
and grumble. So her mother said: "Hurry up
and go home now, child, before it gets dark.
Fetch the baby (the neighbours had taken charge
of it for the day), light the fire, put on the kettle,
and peel and boil the potatoes for supper."</p>

<p>K&auml;the was only too glad to be let off; her
tiredness soon vanished as she flew down the
steep, grassy slope of the Dachberg, slipping and
tumbling every minute. The sun was low, and
glowed through the pines and larches, which
stand here together, making a wonderful contrast.</p>

<p>K&auml;the found her way across the wet emerald
field coloured with patches of exquisite lilac
from the autumn crocuses growing there in
thousands, hanging out their cheeky little orange
tongues. She sang and shouted for joy, and a
feeling half sadness, half exhilaration, that comes
to us often at the twilight, came over her. She
wore a little red skirt and loose cotton blouse,
and a tidy pinafore put on in order to cover her
soiled frock on the way home. Her hair was ash
blonde, and braided in two plaits round her
head. Her eyes were dark and deep-set, and
were a strange contrast to her hair. She passed
over the tiny bridge where the brook crosses the
field, and gathered a bunch of wild flowers,
meadowsweet and harebells, water forget-me-nots
and ragged robin, and made a pretty nosegay.
She also picked a graceful spray of hops, the
leaves slightly tinged with red, and wound it in
and out of her hair. She had forgotten the baby
and the supper and all the things for which she
was responsible, and was just a little maiden
living in her own enchanted land.</p>

<p>Now the path wound close by the pine woods,
and the air seemed to grow chillier and more
solemn. She saw great white clouds resting on
the Dachberg above her. She seemed so far
away, down in this valley and so alone. But she
knew that her father and mother were near,
probably watching her from the hill-top; it was
silly to be frightened, she knew the way so well.</p>

<p>Suddenly something sprang out of the bushes
on to the path in front of her. She gave a great
jump, but then so did he and she saw that it
was only an old green frog. He cheered her up
at once, and she began to poke at him with a
stick and to sing:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"The frog sits in the rushes,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="ind1">The funny fat old man,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;And sings his evening ditties</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="ind1">As sweetly as he can,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Quark&mdash;Quark&mdash;Quark."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>But as suddenly as he had appeared on the
scene, the frog vanished again with a leap and
a bound into the dark waters of the little brook
that ran along by the side of the way.</p>

<p>Then she heard a rustling of the bushes and
saw a little red squirrel peering at her with his
bright, inquisitive eyes. Round and round the
tree-trunk he went, enjoying himself thoroughly,
and making fun of K&auml;thchen, playing peep-bo
like a baby.</p>

<p>The sun glowed through the tree trunks. It
must be about six o'clock. "I must hurry up
or supper will not be ready when my father and
mother come home," she thought.</p>

<p>She then became aware of the sound of footsteps
coming towards her along the path.</p>

<p>"Probably a peasant from Altenhain," she
thought, and was pleased to think of meeting a
friend. But the footsteps sounded strange and
light, more like the pattering of raindrops through
leaves, and then for a moment, she turned giddy;
it seemed to her as if the trees were really rushing
past her, as they seem to do when we look at them
out of a railway carriage. One of the young oak
trees seemed to be running towards her down the
path; but as she looked more closely, and her
head became steadier, she saw that it was a boy
a little older than herself, who came running
towards her, and very queer he looked.</p>

<p>He had a great mass of brown curly hair
tumbling about his head; green ears&mdash;it seemed
to her, <i>could</i> it be possible? No, it must be that
he had stuck oak leaves into his curly locks
for ornament, pretty oak leaves tinged with
soft red. Moreover he had the bluest and
strangest eyes she had ever seen. They shone
like wonderful jewels at one moment, and then
turned dull and opaque and looked almost dead.
He had on rough green trousers, and a white
shirt with yellow embroidered braces; his feet
were bare and very brown. When he saw K&auml;the,
he gave a wild kind of Indian whoop, and
danced round and round her, much to the poor
child's dismay, his eyes flashing all sorts of
colours. Her heart beat fast, but not a word or
sound would come out of her mouth.</p>

<p>The boy then made a deep bow, and took her
by the hand. Soon he had his long arms round
her waist and was trying to kiss her.</p>

<p>K&auml;the began to cry with fear and indignation,
"You rude, naughty boy," she said, "I will tell
my mother of you."</p>

<p>The imp seemed much surprised, caught one
of her tears on his finger, held it up to the light
and then sucked it, making funny faces all the
time. K&auml;the could not help laughing, and then
she dried her tears with a corner of her apron.
She sat down on a tree-trunk for a moment and
tried to think.</p>

<p>Immediately the boy sat by her, and begged
her to give him a kiss. He looked quite nice and
pretty for the moment, and K&auml;the thought she
had better do as he wished, or he might begin
his antics again. So she gave him a motherly
kiss, just as she would give to her baby brother,
smack! on the cheek. Immediately the queer
look went out of his eyes, and a more human
expression took its place.</p>

<p>"K&auml;the," he said, "K&auml;the, I am but a lonely
little imp of the forest, but I love you, K&auml;the,
and I want you to marry me, and live with me
always, and be my own little wife. Will you,
O will you? O <i>do, do</i>, do," he said, dancing up
and down in wild excitement.</p>

<p>"O goodness gracious me, you are certainly
quite crazy," said K&auml;the, "I will tell my
mother of you!" She began to cry again, and
smacked him whenever he tried to come near her.</p>

<p>Then he seized her by the hand and dragged
her after him into the wild woods, till they were
lost in the forest.</p>

<p>"O dear, O dear, whatever <i>shall</i> I do? what
will mother say when she finds no K&auml;the, no
supper, and no baby. Boo-o-o-o!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said our imp consolingly,
"you can't help it now, you have run away with
me you see."</p>

<p>"I didn't, indeed I didn't," interrupted K&auml;the
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I will send a moonshine K&auml;thchen to take
your place for the night. You <i>are</i> fond of dreaming,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"O yes, mother often calls me 'Tr&auml;um Lies'
(Dreaming Liese)."</p>

<p>"Well then, it's all right, she will not notice
anything, and you and I will have fine times
together. If you won't marry me, at least, we
can get <i>engaged</i> you know, that will be fine
fun."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;&mdash;" said K&auml;the, "that <i>would</i> be
amusing. We might <i>play</i> at being engaged!
that would not matter."</p>

<p>"Have you a gold ring for me?"</p>

<p>"O we will go and buy one at the flower
shop," said he.</p>

<p>"At the <i>flower</i> shop, that is a funny place to
buy rings at," said K&auml;the.</p>

<p>"Buttercups and dandelions melted to a yellow
heat make splendid fairy gold," he replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, then you really <i>are</i> a fairy!" said the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Why of course, did you think I was a human
child like you? What <i>did</i> they teach you at
school?"</p>

<p>"Reading, writing and arithmetic, history and
geography and scripture and sewing," said K&auml;the.</p>

<p>"But not how to know a fairy when you see
one, O my stars!" said our hero.</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>So he sang, and K&auml;thchen thought to herself:
"I've always suspected that we did not learn
<i>everything</i> at school."</p>

<p>By this time her little head was completely
turned; she thought no more of supper or mother
or baby, but only wondered with round eyes
what would happen next.</p>

<p>The moon shone brilliantly through the
branches, and she noticed that the trees began
to move, and some of them quickly changed places.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the trees dance?" said
our hero. We will call him Green Ears; for I had
forgotten to say that being a tree-imp, his ears
were shaped like oak leaves, and were green
tinged with pinky red. It was peculiar of course,
but not so very noticeable on account of his
thick curly hair. He was able to move them if
anything startled him, to prick up his ears in
very truth; then you saw that they really <i>belonged</i>
to him.</p>

<p>The trees did not wait for K&auml;the to reply; they
formed themselves in long avenues and began a
stately dance, something like a quadrille.</p>

<p>A soft fairy music was played by an invisible
band. Squirrels sprang at intervals from one
tree to another, spreading out their bushy tails
and uttering strange cries like new-born
babies.</p>

<p>Birds flew in and out singing and keeping time
to the music and rhythm of the dance. It was
a strange sight, grotesque yet beautiful; the
trees took half human forms and faces; it was
funny to see how they joined hands (or branches)
from time to time in the dance. After they had
watched for some time and the sport had become
monotonous, Green Ears took K&auml;the to the top of
the hill, and there they saw the beautiful peaked
mountain called the Rossert, bathed in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"Well, children, enjoying yourselves on this
fine night, I hope?" said a woman of tall and
commanding presence. "Will you come home
and have supper with me? I am sure Green
Ears has forgotten to offer you anything to eat."</p>

<p>Here she chucked him under his pointed chin.</p>

<p>The two children, fairy and human, turned and
followed her, they felt that she was a person of
authority and must be obeyed. Her fair hair
fell in waving masses almost to her feet, it was
covered with soft feathers, as if she had recently
been filling feather beds.</p>

<p>The children saw a lighted cottage before them,
with red roof and black-beamed walls like so
many in the Taunus. A strong smell of honeysuckle
was wafted towards them.</p>

<p>"This is my wood cottage, it is quite close to
the Rossert, as you see. Some people call me
the wood-woman, others Frau Holle," she said.
"The Old King (the mountain called Altk&ouml;nig)
is my brother; Olle (slang in German for <i>old</i>) or
Holle, it is all the same, we are all relations in
the Taunus, you must know!"</p>

<p>In front of the house was a dear little garden.
The moonlight shone brightly on the flower-beds.
The fairies were awake and peeped out with the
greatest interest as the children entered.</p>

<p>Over the door was written in letters made of
light, like those beautiful advertisements of beer
and chocolate which so adorn the city of London
by night:</p>

<h3>THIS WAY TO FAIRYLAND.</h3>

<p>K&auml;the felt that she was learning more in one
night than in all her life before of that strange
dream-world on the borders of which we live.</p>

<p>The house was so neat and tidy, that it looked
as if it had just been spring-cleaned; the windows
stood wide open, the moonlight streamed in. A
little table was laid for supper.</p>

<p>Frau Holle invited them to sit down and they
did so at once.</p>

<p>Green Ears sat opposite to K&auml;the staring at her
with a wistful expression of adoration and love
in his eyes.</p>

<p>A chocolate pudding with cream and sugar and
a bilberry jelly stood on the table, also rolls
which were thickly buttered and spread with
various kinds of fairy sausage purely vegetarian
in character. Mugs of delicious-looking milk
were ready for each child.</p>

<p>But the supper reminded K&auml;the of her home
and she felt a little uneasy.</p>

<p>However she had <i>at the bottom of all</i> a comfortable
feeling that all was right. This is the
way with many of our self-imposed troubles, big
people's as well as little people's. We groan and
grumble, and express our views that everything is
very wrong, and the world is soon going to the dogs,
but <i>at the bottom of all</i>, we know that it is all
right, and that all things work together for good.</p>

<p>Green Ears began to fidget; he was like a little
girl I know, and <i>could</i> not sit still for more than
one minute.</p>

<p>"Frau Holle," he said, "Frau Holle,
Gracious Lady, we want to get engaged."</p>

<p>Frau Holle burst out laughing: "A mortal
child and a Kobold of the forest! nonsense, it's
impossible!"</p>

<p>K&auml;thchen lifted up her brown eyes. "We
might play at it," she said. "It would be a
beautiful game."</p>

<p>Frau Holle chuckled so much at this that she
nearly upset the milk jug.</p>

<p>"How <i>do</i> people get engaged?" said K&auml;the.
"I have often thought about it, but I never
could imagine how they do it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't they teach you that at school either?"
said Green Ears. "My stars! What <i>did</i> they
teach you at school?"</p>

<p>"Children," said the wood-woman, "children,
do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Green Ears.</p>

<p>"I think so," said K&auml;the.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to buy rings?"</p>

<p>"O yes," decidedly from both children.</p>

<p>"Now listen; there is a passage from my house
leading to the shops, most convenient I assure
you," said Frau Holle. "Everything delivered
punctually on the premises within one minute of
purchasing it. No lifts or motor-cars necessary.
You see I know the ways of the world." So
saying she opened the back door, and they passed
into a lane lighted by many lamp-posts. These
lamp-posts gave a very bright light and had
queer faces like the man in the moon. They
grinned and winked as Green Ears and K&auml;thchen
went by.</p>

<p>It was a lovely fair; a fair in fairyland you
may imagine how gorgeous that must be!</p>

<p>There were stalls on which lay all sorts of
tempting things, cakes, sweet and toys. K&auml;the
felt sorry that she had no money.</p>

<p>At the flower stall they paused; the flowers
were exquisitely arranged, and out of each
peeped a little Fee.</p>

<p>In big gold letters was written:</p>

<h3>CONDENSED FLOWERS FOR SALE.</h3>

<p>As Green Ears asked boldly for engagement
rings, a fairy who stood behind the stall, handed
him two little gold rings made to fit any finger;
they were a new patent and self-adapting, the
fairy said.</p>

<p>Green Ears was so pleased that he turned head
over heels again and again for joy, a funny
proceeding for a would-be husband.</p>

<p>"Do you know <i>how</i> to get engaged," he said
to the fairy.</p>

<p>"Why no, not exactly, but I have heard it is
very simple," said she. "Mother Holle (here
she made a deep curtsy), Mother Holle knows all
about it."</p>

<p>K&auml;the looked out of the corner of her eyes at
her lover, and wished he would behave with more
dignity. Now he was cramming his mouth with
sweeties.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to give me <i>any</i>?" she
said.</p>

<p>"O my stars!" he said again, surprised; it
had never struck him. Imps are usually egoists;
that is to say they think <i>first</i> of themselves.
There are exceptions, but this is the rule.</p>

<p>He went rapidly from stall to stall and returned
with his arms full of parcels done up in pink
paper which he presented to K&auml;thchen with a
low bow. She accepted them with much delight
and they fell to munching chocolate together;
it was a real bond of union, and they were not
the first sweethearts who discovered it.</p>

<p>They reached the end of the street and suddenly
found themselves alone once more on the slopes
of the Altenhainer Thal or Valley.</p>

<p>Green Ears sat down by K&auml;thchen, and squeezed
himself up closely to her.</p>

<p>"Give me your pretty little hand," he said.
"<i>Do</i> you know which is the right finger?"</p>

<p>"O yes!" K&auml;thchen knew that quite well,
though I have heard that it is a disputed point
in Germany.</p>

<p>She stuck out her little hard-worked fingers,
and he put the gold ring on the third finger of
the left hand. It fitted exactly and with a cry
of joy K&auml;thchen put the other on his long brown
finger.</p>

<p>Then both the children laughed and clapped
their hands, and danced merrily about. "Now
we are engaged," they cried, "really engaged
to be married!"</p>

<p>They made such a noise that the squirrels were
cross and threw sticks at them for disturbing
their early-morning sleep.</p>

<p>Then, goodness knows why&mdash;let us call it
reaction&mdash;K&auml;the began to cry again, great, big
drops.</p>

<p>Green Ears was much puzzled.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> clever, now I can't do that," he
said. "You must stay with me always, and live
with me in the woods, and be my own little
sweetheart."</p>

<p>"O no," said K&auml;the, "I should never be
allowed to do that; I must go to school every
day, and then I have my exercises to do, and
to help mother with the housework; the baby to
mind; and&mdash;O I am always so busy."</p>

<p>"I will come and help you," said Green Ears.</p>

<p>"But you <i>can't</i>, you are not <i>real</i>, you know,"
said K&auml;the and began to cry again.</p>

<p>"K&auml;thchen," said Green Ears, and he looked
quite serious and thinky all at once. "Listen
to me. I will go to the Old King; he is the
ruler of all the fairies here, and I will beg him
to teach me how to become human. It may be
years before we meet again, for the way into
your world is very hard for me to find. Yes it
is easier for you to find the way into our world,
than for us to enter yours; but cheer up, I will
dare it and do it for your sake! but O sweetheart
wait for me; O wait for me!"</p>

</div>

<p>So singing they walked arm in arm through
the long winding valley, till the dawn approached
like a golden bird opening its great wings to fly.</p>

<p>K&auml;thchen reached her cottage door. All was
silent within. "Good-bye," she said, and their
eyes met in one last farewell.</p>

<p>"Auf Wiedersehen!" said Green Ears (that
pretty German farewell greeting which means so
much more than good-bye), and then he stole back
down the stony street, kissing his hands again and
again to the little girl.</p>

<p>In some strange way K&auml;thchen passed <i>through</i>
the door of her little cottage; she had become
for the time incorporeal; through the touch of a
fairy her body and soul had become <i>loose</i>, that
is to say, and she was able to enter the house
as silently as a person in a dream. She went
through the kitchen and up the steep wooden
stairs. It seemed to her as if her feet did not
touch the ground, she floated rather than walked.
She reached her own little attic, and saw the
room as if it were a picture, the square window-frame,
the branches of the trees outside, the old
pictures on the walls that she was so fond of.</p>

<p>But what was her surprise to see
<i>herself</i> curled up asleep in her big wooden
bed!</p>

<p>The horror of it made her faint, and she
remembered no more until she found herself in
her own bed under her own big feather sack.
In order that she should not forget her night's
adventures, or think it was all merely a dream,
she found a ring of yellow grass wound tightly
round her third finger. From that hour, though
the ring fell to pieces, the mark of it was clearly
to be seen on her finger. It <i>was</i> a fairy ring,
you see.</p>

<p>Her mother apparently had not missed her,
and the baby was as jolly as ever.</p>

<p>"What <i>was</i> the matter with you last night,
K&auml;the?" said her mother. "You were dreamier
than ever; not a word could we get out of you.
You <i>must</i> have been tired out, you poor child!"</p>

<p>"But everything was all right, wasn't it,
mother, the potatoes were boiled and the supper
ready?"</p>

<p>"Why of course you managed very nicely.
Now hurry up and let us have breakfast."</p>

<p>Now I feel sure that all the children who read
this story will want to know what happened to
K&auml;thchen and Green Ears later on.</p>

<p>Did he really come back to visit her as a
grown man?</p>

<p>Did they marry and live happy ever after?</p>

<p>Had he green ears as a mortal?</p>

<p>But alas the fairies who told me this story, have
left these questions unanswered, at all events for
the present, so I can only guess at the conclusion.</p>

<p>I think myself that Green Ears was pretty sure
to succeed in his quest, because if you want a
thing intensely enough, you can usually get it.</p>

<p>They would make a rather funny married
couple, that is true, and we will hope that Green
Ears did not turn head over heels on his marriage
day.</p>

<p>But the fairies assure me that the trials necessary
to pass through in order to become a mortal,
have a very sobering effect on the character, and
so we can think of Green Ears as quite different,
though still fascinating and charming.</p>

<p>I would have liked to be present at their
wedding, wouldn't you?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OLD_KING" id="THE_OLD_KING"></a>THE OLD KING</h2>

<p>Walter had been playing with his kite in the
garden. Somehow or other it would never mount
properly, unless his father was there to help him.
It was apt to fly up a little way, and then to fall
into a bush or fence, and there to perch like a
big bird, until Walter and his friends rescued it
with difficulty. But on a windy day when his
father took him into the open fields, away the kite
would sail, until Walter grew anxious lest it
should disappear altogether in cloudland.</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon, about three o'clock, a
lazy, sleepy time of day. A queer jumble of all
the fairy stories that the boy knew, passed through
his head as he sat on the lawn, day-dreaming,
while his kite flapped its wings on the ground
beside him.</p>

<p>Now you must know that it happened to be
Midsummer Eve, the summer f&ecirc;te day of the
fairies. Walter stared at the mountains whose
great purple heads he could see in the far
distance across the green plain. How they
changed from moment to moment, as the clouds
cast their shadows on them, till the sun shone
out bright again and chased away the shadows.
As Walter looked intently at his favourite peak,
a mountain called the Old King, he saw a
shining cloud on the summit against the sky,
that he had never noticed there before. As he
gazed and gazed, the cloud seemed to form itself
into a wonderful castle. Each turret and tower
was of an exquisite hue like the clouds at sunset.
Grey mists wreathed round it, and made a soft,
mysterious background: the castle became more
vivid and shone like gold.</p>

<p>How should Walter reach this fairy palace?
For reach it he felt that he must! His kite had an
answer ready. It jumped up from the ground,
and looked at him with a queerly human expression,
and seemed to say: "Sail me!"</p>

<p>Walter gave but one touch to unwind the
string, and up, up it mounted like the Parzival
airship, bearing the little boy with it, who held
tight to the end of the cord. He felt rather giddy
and frightened at first, but soon found out that
by holding the cord in his hands to give him
confidence, and making movements in the air,
similar to those of swimming, he could fly quite
easily.</p>

<p>Most of us have experienced this delightful
sensation in our dreams, and I have heard
children declare that when they were small, they
used to fly downstairs without even touching the
banisters. Perhaps flying may be a forgotten
art: or perhaps we have not yet learned to discover,
and to use our wings.</p>

<p>To Walter it came quite naturally; on, on they
flew over the trees, and over the houses, over the
windings of the Nidda. Walter could hear the
tinkle tinkle of sheep bells below, or was it
possible that he could already hear the bells of
fairyland ringing? Over the church spire of a
little village they soared, and all the children
shouted: "Zeppelin! Zeppelin!" because you
see all this happened in modern times, when
even the children no longer believe in the supernatural.</p>

<p>As the kite flew nearer to the mountains Walter
could see the well-known tower of the Feldberg,
and the inns kept by the landlords Storm and
Monster; he could see the castle of Cronberg,
and the interesting village of Falkenstein.</p>

<p>But where was the beautiful palace on the
Altk&ouml;nig? Here was nothing to be seen but
trees, trees, trees. He would have thought it all
a dream, were it not for his wonderful flight
through the air. The kite now dropped gradually,
and set Walter on the ground. Then it began
to flap about undecidedly, and behave queerly,
like a dog seeking for a trail. At last it set off
again up a narrow path leading straight into the
green woods.</p>

<p>Walter followed, still holding tight by its tail,
no longer soaring but skimming the ground.
Once or twice the poor kite was entangled in the
branches, Walter freed it, and off it set again at
a fine pace up the mountain-side.</p>

<p>Walter began to feel hungry; for there is
nothing like flying to give you an appetite, as Mr
Euler would surely tell you, but the kite allowed
him no time even to gather a few raspberries on
the way. At last they came to a place where
several paths crossed. Here the woods took
another character: dark firs grew in the place
of beeches and oaks. These firs were covered
with a silver lichen that looked like hoar
frost.</p>

<p>A little hut made of rough logs of woods stood
at this crossing. At the door stood a little old
woman. She had neither red eyes nor a hooked
nose; so Walter thought to himself: "She cannot
be a wicked old witch like the one who caught
H&auml;nsel and Gretel." She had a friendly, grandmotherly
face, and invited Walter to come into
her hut.</p>

<p>"You must be so hungry, you poor little man,"
she said. "Come in, come in, the coffee is all
hot and waiting for you!" Then she turned to
the kite which was turning head over heels, and
making grimaces on the ground. "Be off with
you," she said, "we shall not need you any
more!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye, dear kite," said Walter,
"thank you very much for bringing me
here."</p>

<p>The kite grinned and made a funny bow; then
he mounted up of his own accord, and sailed
away home over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>On a rough wooden table was spread a delicious
repast. Rolls and butter, coffee and milk,
Streuselkuchen and Butterkuchen such as German
children love, and also cakes called Bubenschenkel&mdash;or
little boy's legs. Walter did not
quite like the name of these cakes; it made him
think of witches again; but they tasted quite
harmless.</p>

<p>Whilst he was eating his cake, there was a
knock at the door of the hut, and in came a
smart fox, wearing a red cap with green feather,
and a jaunty coat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Heigho! How fine you are, Mr Fox," said
the old woman, "I suppose you are going to the
ball to-night?"</p>

<p>"O yes, of course, I am going to be there early.
Miss Bushy Tail has promised to be my partner
for the Polonaise," he said. "I hope you have
a cup of coffee ready for me." He then sat
down, and peered at Walter with his bright,
inquisitive eyes. Now everyone knows that the
foxes dance on the Feldberg on May Day. On
one of the biggest fir-trees there hangs a picture
of two foxes dancing, and these cross-roads have
thence derived their name Fuchstanz. But they
do not only dance on May Day, but on many
other occasions such as the present. Walter had
often wished that he could see them at their
sports.</p>

<p>Presently there was a scratching at the window,
and in came a squirrel in a great hurry with a
bag of nuts slung over his shoulder. He disturbed
the great black cat who was asleep on the window-sill,
and she bristled with rage, and swore at
him; but he took no notice, and was off again
in a jiffy, after having drunk a tiny little
glass of milk which stood all ready for him on
the table. The squirrels were very busy; for a
great many nuts were required for the feast,
and they had been turning out their store
cupboards.</p>

<p>A little hare peeped shyly in at the door.
"Hullo!" he said. "Fine doings at the castle
to-night. I am carrying up a basket or so of
Easter Eggs. They are sure to please the Old
King," and off he went.</p>

<p>"Is he really the Easter Hare?" asked Walter;
but no one answered his question.</p>

<p>The old woman smiled mysteriously. When
Walter had finished his coffee, she said: "Now
my little dear, you must be off as well, or you
will be late at the castle. It is a great privilege
for you to be invited; it is long since the Old
King has sent for a mortal child."</p>

<p>"But did he send for me?" said Walter,
astonished.</p>

<p>"Why of course, or how could you have got
here alone," said the fairy. "But be very
polite and answer nicely when spoken to, or the
Old King might be angry, and when he is angry
the whole mountain shakes, and I crouch and
tremble in my little hut. But now let us see if
I have not got something fine for you," so
speaking she pulled out a sack of toys that stood
in a dark corner and gave Walter a cart and
horse. At first it was quite small; but when she
set it on the floor, it grew and grew until it was
large enough for a seven year's old boy to ride
in. And O marvel, the wooden horse began to
prance as if it were alive!</p>

<p>Walter sprang into the cart; the door of the
hut stood wide open, and out he drove.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye," said the fairy of Fuchstanz.
She gave him a bag of gingerbread nuts,
beautifully ornamented, as the peasants in the
Odenwald know how to make them. One had
on it:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
"For a good boy."
</p>
</div>

<p>It was an invitation from the Old King and
was worded as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="text">

<tr><td align="right"><span class="smallcaps">Old King.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>"Good-bye, I will come to see you again very
soon," said Walter, and he drove up the mountain
in fine style.</p>

<p>It was now getting quite dark; for he had stayed
longer than he was aware of in the little hut;
the firs stood black and deep on either hand; he
would have been frightened perhaps, but he was
tired; he closed his eyes and played at being asleep
in his little bed at home. When he opened his
eyes again, he saw bright lights flitting through
the gloomy fir-trees like so many luminous
butterflies. One flew towards him, and settled
on the side of his cart, and he saw that it was
a lovely elf with a crown of gold on his head.
"King Oberon himself," thought Walter, and
the elf answered, as all fairies do, to his <i>thought</i>:</p>

<p>"Yes I am Oberon, King of the fairies," he
said in a voice in a high key like the hum of
insects. "I have come to look at you, it is so
long since I have spoken to a mortal child.
Mortals care no longer for us; they like true
stories&mdash;that is stories about their own stupid
little lives; 'fairies do not exist,' they say, Ha,
ha, ha! we pinch their silly little toes, and send
them bad dreams, and hide their toys, and blot
their copy-books, and then we do not exist, Ha,
ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"But I care very much," said Walter eagerly.
"O won't you come home with me and live with
me always and sleep in my bed, you beautiful
little Elf-man." And he put out his hand to
catch the fairy as a child might grasp at a butterfly.
But&mdash;puff!&mdash;he was off like a seed of the
thistledown, and a peal of fairy laughter sounded
in his ears. Then all was still and dark again.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sound of bells broke the stillness
ling, lang, ding dong. These were the foxgloves,
and the balsams popped like tiny pistols, and
from the tall mosses came sudden explosions and
the scattering of illuminated spores. All this in
honour of the night.</p>

<p>Suddenly Walter became aware of a huge
rock in front of him. Towering up black and
high on its summit was the wonderful castle that
he had seen from the distant plain. White and
grey were its cloudy walls, rose and lemon and
emerald its towers and turrets; its roof was the
sky studded with a thousand diamond-rayed stars.</p>

<p>The horse could go no farther; his mission was
accomplished. The boy bade his dear steed farewell
with many fond regrets, and set out with
a brave heart to scale the rock alone. It was
a difficult and dangerous climb in the dark night;
but, however, he managed with the help of
bushes and shrubs to reach nearly to the top.
But alas the last step was too steep for the little
boy; it was a sheer, perpendicular wall. Our
hero looked round in despair; big drops gathered
in his eyes; but he <i>would</i> not let them fall. He
stood quite still, clinging to the rock and unable
to move either forward or backward. It seemed
like the climax of a bad dream. Suddenly he
saw a bright cloud approaching him, and the air
was full of a multitude of tiny elves. They
seized hold of him by his coat and knickers and
boots and even by his curly hair, and bore him
upwards singing:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"Fairies seek and fairies save</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Children who are bold and brave."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>So they supported him up the last step and
they floated off as they had come, looking in the
distance like a cloud of bright fireflies.</p>

<p>Walter now found himself in a dark, mysterious
garden. The bushes and trees took strange forms
and seemed alive. One shrub that looked like a
big black bear gave a low growl, as he passed by.
He was really frightened and his little heart beat
fast, in spite of all the fairies had said in praise
of his bravery. But he soon reached a lovely
lighted avenue leading straight up to the entrance
of the castle. The doors were open wide. Two
large white owls stood on either side as sentinels.
A stream of light poured out of the hall and
dazzled Walter's eyes, so that he could not see
distinctly at first. Graceful wood nymphs stood
chatting in groups. A statue of Siegfried slaying
the dragon was in the centre of the hall.
Small fountains played round it. It seemed as if
he were expected at the castle as his arrival
created no surprise. Two fairies advanced and
took him by the hand. Walter thought they
were the loveliest ladies he had ever seen. One
was fair and dressed in cloudy gauze which
changed in colour from blue to green and mauve
like opalescent waters; the other was dark and
wore a dress of rose colour that changed into
orange and red like leaping flames of fire. These
were the geniuses of water and fire. Walter did
not know this at the time; at least he only
guessed it; he was too young to speculate as to the
nature of the strange sights he saw. He found
himself suddenly in a Court suit of white woollen
material, beautifully embroidered and lined with
silver.</p>

<p>"Now you are a cloud with a silver lining,"
his fairy friends said to him smiling. "You
are sure to please the Old King."</p>

<p>Wonderful fairy creatures, nixies and gnomes
and goblins arrived every minute as guests for
the castle. The hare came in quite breathless
with a basket which he delivered up to an attendant,
saying: "Eggs for His Majesty."</p>

<p>The fox from Fuchstanz seemed to feel himself
very important; he swaggered about, knocking
people with his bushy tail. He stuck out a paw
condescendingly for Walter to shake as he went
by, and stared at him more inquisitively than
ever.</p>

<p>An elderly woman who would have been very
neat and tidy, save that her hair was white with
snowflakes (no, it could not be snow, it was little
feathers as soft as down) came in smiling with
a pot of bilberry jam under her arm. She had
come from the Rossert Mountain, and the jam
had been cooked as was her custom on the Holle
Stone, that mysterious stone on the slopes of the
Rossert, so neatly marked on the Taunus map,
but so impossible for the curious mortal to find.</p>

<p>Gradually all these strange guests began to
form into a long procession, and to march round
the hall to the sound of fairy music.</p>

<p>One side of the wall was draped with a green
curtain; this began to sway and draw itself aside.
A fresh, invigorating mountain air blew in their
faces; they marched on to a larger and loftier
room. The ceiling was the sky; the light was the
light of thousands of stars, the same stars that
we know, but shining with greater brilliancy for
the fairies on Midsummer Eve. The floor was
carpeted with the softest moss. Walter's feet
sank into it. They marched through green arches
made by skilfully interlaced trees. Pines and
larches were arranged as pillars, and were
adorned by festoons of wild roses, forming
garlands from one to the other.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room stood two tall
poplar trees, and between them seated on a cloudy
throne was a majestic being with flowing white
beard, and a crown of gold on his head. As
Walter approached the throne, the poplar leaves
shook and shivered as before a thunderstorm.
Then a great wind arose, a mist rose up, the fairy
procession bowed down before the Old King&mdash;the
Ruler of the Mountain. Then there was a sound
like the rumbling of thunder, and the Old King
spoke. Walter had some difficulty at first in
catching the words, but by nudges, pinches, and
pokes, the company gave him to understand that
they were addressed to him.</p>

<p>"What is your name? mortal child," said the
Old King.</p>

<p>"Walter, please Your Majesty," said Walter
with a deep bow, feeling his courage going into
his boots.</p>

<p>"Walter&mdash;a good old German name," said
the Old King. "Doubtless you are a poet?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said our hero valiantly, "when I am
a man I mean to write story poems like Schiller
and Uhland."</p>

<p>"That is right," said the Old King. "Real
poets are rare in these days. Even if I appear
to them in all my splendour the stupid people
merely remark 'a curious cloud formation,' and
think they know all about it. You are young"&mdash;he
went on&mdash;"you will forget all that you have
seen here; but the feeling will remain that the
heavens are near you. Who knows but what you
may be a real poet in the future, a poet who shall
open men's eyes once more to the invisible world
which lies so near them. Remember your beautiful
costume and show always the cloud with the
silver lining in your poems."</p>

<p>"Which do you like best, work or play?"
continued His Majesty in a voice like distant
rolls of thunder.</p>

<p>"Play, please Your Majesty," said Walter,
tremulously.</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right, play play all the
day&mdash;good folk say&mdash;good folk say! Do you cry
much? My children are all such cry babies, and
though I scold them and lecture them every day,
they will not learn to behave better."</p>

<p>Walter had no time to answer; for clouds came
rolling up and almost hid him from view.</p>

<p>"These are my troublesome children," said
the Old King.</p>

<p>Some of the clouds were dear little cuddly
babies, others looked like great white poodles,
others like huge black bears or crocodiles. With
outstretched arms and wing&egrave;d helmets strange
forms rode by on swift horses with floating manes
resembling the Walk&uuml;re of old; the lightning
played across the sky as they passed. Truly they
were a strange family with much originality.</p>

<p>"Now, children, be off with you, and whatever
you do, <i>don't cry</i>," said the Old King. But even
as he spoke, one little cloud dissolved in raindrops
and wetted the fine clothes of the company.</p>

<p>Presently a push and a bustle began. Long,
narrow tables were brought into the hall, and in
a short space of time they were covered with the
most wonderful dainties in the way of sweets and
cakes, jellies, puddings and fruit.</p>

<p>Walter sat down hastily: a fine plate of Easter
eggs and nuts was before him. He helped himself
plentifully, and even filled his pockets, which
was not quite good manners you know, but
seemed to excite no notice.</p>

<p>A venerable water-sprite rose presently and
proposed the health of the Old King. Wine-glasses
were filled to the brim with golden or
crimson wine; as the glasses clinked together, the
vibrations sounded sweet yet sad like some high
violin note, as it dies on the string. Then a wind
arose, summer lightning played round the room,
illuminating vividly the faces of that strange
company; a roar of thunder shook the castle.
Brunhilde's fire sprang up suddenly round the
outer walls, so that the scene was brighter than
daylight. The tables were cleared away, and the
wildest revels began. The Old King faded into
the distance like a mountain-peak. A goblin
seized hold of Walter and tore him round in the
maddest fashion.</p>

<p>The foxes had a corner to themselves; their
dancing was evidently much admired. Especially
our friend and his sweetheart Miss Bushy Tail
distinguished themselves by the elegance of their
steps.</p>

<p>Mother Holle seemed to keep a certain amount
of order, but the revels became wilder and wilder
and Walter grew strangely sleepy and tired; he
felt himself a part of some mad dream. As he
dreamed, great clouds came rolling up, and all
was lost in mist. When the mist cleared, Walter
stood once more before the throne of the Old
King.</p>

<p>"Come my little fleecy," the Old King was
saying to a little girl cloud who came tumbling
down before him. "Be the best of daughters and
take this little boy home; you know the way.
But mind, no tears!"</p>

<p>"Adieu," he said to Walter. Walter murmured
adieu, and, in another moment, he was
flying with his arm round the neck of the baby
cloud, flying, flying, flying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He knew no more till he found himself in his
garden at home, feeling rather queer and sleepy.
He got up, and stretched himself, and found that
he was quite wet; for the little cloud had dissolved
in tears at parting from him. On the ground
lay his kite looking quite innocent.</p>

<p>He went indoors, and found it was tea-time,
and everything was just as usual.</p>

<p>"Why, child, you are quite wet! Why did you
not come in during the shower?" he heard his
mother's voice saying to him.</p>

<p>He found a huge walnut in his pocket and when
he cracked it out crawled a wonderful beetle with
green body streaked with gold. As Walter put
out his hand to secure his treasure, it flew away
from him looking very much like King Oberon
himself. Walter thought that he heard a peal
of fairy laughter, but it might have been only
his fancy.</p>

<p>The next day was his birthday, and what do
you think he had as a present? Why the very
same cart and horse that had carried him to the
castle, big enough to ride in. But he never told
anyone&mdash;even his mother&mdash;the whole story of his
adventures. Perhaps he did not remember them
clearly himself; for the fairies protect their
secrets well, and draw in sleep the veil of forgetfulness
over much that we have seen in our
dreams.</p>

<p>And did Walter become a great poet? He
is a friend of mine, so I can tell you. The world
has not heard of him as yet. He tells me that
he often hears a little voice near him, singing,
singing; sometimes he can distinguish the words
and the melodies. They make him feel sad at
times, he says, with longing for a world that is
more beautiful than ours, but oftener they make
him feel exhilarated and happy.</p>

<p>He thinks that he knows many secret things
that would make the world happier if he could
only get people to believe them. But these secrets
are not about high explosives or torpedoes or
aeroplanes, or motor-cars that can do the distance
between Paris and Berlin at the very shortest
record. They are secrets that can only be breathed
in music and poetry.</p>

<p>Be on the look-out for him, children; for the
songs he sings will be full of wonder, like Kubla
Khan, and the melodies will be those of fairyland.
Did he not hear them himself on the Old King's
Mountain, when he attended the Midsummer
f&ecirc;te of the fairies?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DRAGONS_TAIL" id="THE_DRAGONS_TAIL"></a>THE DRAGON'S TAIL</h2>

<p>I wonder if the girls and boys who read these
stories, have heard of the charming and romantic
town of Eisenach? I suppose not, for it is a
curious fact that few English people visit the
place, though very many Americans go there.
Americans are well known to have a special
interest in old places with historical associations,
because they have nothing of the sort in America;
moreover many of them are Germans by birth,
and have heard stories of the Wartburg, that
beautiful old castle, which from the summit of
a hill, surrounded by woods, overlooks the town
of Eisenach.</p>

<p>The Wartburg is quaintly built with dear little
turrets and gables, and high towers, a long
curving wall with dark beams like the peasant
cottages, and windows looking out into the forest.
It belongs at present to the Grand duke of
Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach.</p>

<p>Every stone and corner of the Wartburg is
connected with some old story or legend.</p>

<p>For instance there is the hall with the raised
dais at one end and beautiful pillars supporting
the roof where minnesingers of old times used
to hold their great "musical festivals" as we
should say nowadays. There was keen competition
for the prizes that were offered in reward for
the best music and songs.</p>

<p>In the castle are also the rooms of St Elizabeth,
that sweet saint who was so good to the poor, and
who suffered so terribly herself in parting from
her husband and children.</p>

<p>Then there is the lion on the roof who could
tell a fine tale if he chose; the great banqueting
hall and the little chapel.</p>

<p>On the top of the tower is a beautiful cross
that is lit up at night by electric light and can
be seen from a great distance in the country
round. This is of course a modern addition.</p>

<p>But the most interesting room in the castle is
that where Dr Martin Luther spent his time
translating the Bible. A reward had been offered
to anyone who should kill this arch-heretic; so
his friends brought him disguised as a knight to
the Wartburg, and very few people knew of his
whereabouts.</p>

<p>As you look through the latticed windows of
that little room, the exquisite blue and purple
hills of the Th&uuml;ringen-Wald stretch away in the
distance, and no human habitation is to be seen.
There too you may see the famous spot on the
wall where Luther threw the inkpot at the devil.
To be correct you can see the hole where the ink-stain
used to be; for visitors have cut away every
trace of the ink, and even portions of the old
wooden bedstead. There is the writing-desk with
the translation of the Bible, and the remarkable
footstool that consisted of the bone of a
mammoth.</p>

<p>Those were the days in which a man risked his
life for his faith; but they were the days also,
we must remember, of witchcraft and magic.</p>

<p>One other story of the Wartburg I must narrate
in order to give you some idea of the interest
that still surrounds the place, and influences the
children who grow up there. It was in the days
of the old Emperor Barbarossa (Redbeard).</p>

<p>The sister of the Emperor whose name was
Jutta, was married to the Landgraf Ludwig of
Th&uuml;ringen, and they lived at the Wartburg.</p>

<p>One day when Barbarossa came to visit them,
he observed that the castle had no outer walls
round it, as was usual in those days.</p>

<p>"What a pity," he said, "that such a fine
castle should be unprotected by walls and ramparts,
it ought to be more strongly fortified."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Landgraf Ludwig, "if that is
all the castle needs, it can soon have them."</p>

<p>"How soon?" said the Emperor, mockingly.</p>

<p>"In the space of three days," answered his
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"That could only be possible with the aid of
the devil," said Barbarossa, "otherwise it could
not be done."</p>

<p>"Wait and see for yourself," said the Landgraf.</p>

<p>On the third day of his visit, Ludwig said to
the Emperor: "Would you care to see the walls?
They are finished now."</p>

<p>Barbarossa crossed himself several times, and
prepared for some fearful manifestation of black
magic; but what was his surprise to see a living
wall round the castle of stout peasants and
burghers, ready armed, with weapons in their
hands; the banners of well-known knights and
lords waved their pennants in the wind where
battlements should have been.</p>

<p>The Emperor was much astonished, and called
out: "Many thanks, brother-in-law, for your
lesson; stronger walls I have never seen, nor
better fitted together."</p>

<p>"Rough stones they may some of them be,"
said the Landgraf, "yet I can rely on them, as
you see."</p>

<p>Now as you may imagine, the children who grow
up in this town, must have their heads full of
these tales, and many poets and artists have been
inspired by the beauties of Eisenach. The natural
surroundings of the town are so wonderful, that
they also provide rich material for the imagination.</p>

<p>Helmut was a boy who lived in Eisenach. He
was eight years old, and went to a day school.
He lived outside the town, not far from the
entrance to the forest. He was a pale, fair-haired
little boy, and did not look the tremendous hero
he fancied himself in his dreams; not even when
he buckled on helmet, breast-plate and sword,
and marched out into the street to take his part
in the warfare that went on constantly there,
between the boys of this neighbourhood, and the
boys who belonged to another part of the town.</p>

<p>Now the Dragon's Gorge is a most marvellous
place; it is surrounded on all sides by thick
forests, and you come on it suddenly when walking
in the woods. It is a group of huge green
rocks like cliffs that stand picturesquely piled
close together, towering up to the sky. There is
only a very narrow pathway between them.</p>

<p>Helmut had often been there with his father
and mother or with other boys. After heavy rain
or thawing snow it became impassable; at the
best of times it was advisable for a lady not to
put on her Sunday hat, especially if it were
large and had feathers; for the rocks are constantly
dripping with water. The great boulders
are covered with green moss or tiny ferns; and
in the spring time, wood sorrel grows on them
in great patches, the under side of the leaves
tinged an exquisite violet or pink colour. The
entrance to the Dragon's Gorge is through these
rocks; they narrow and almost meet overhead,
obscuring the sky, till it seems as if one were
walking under the sea. Two persons cannot walk
side by side here. In some parts, indeed, one can
only just squeeze through; the way winds in and
out in the most curious manner; there are little
side passages too, that you could hardly get into
at all.</p>

<p>In some places you can hear the water roaring
under your feet; then the rocks end abruptly and
you come out into the forest again, and hear the
birds singing and see the little brook dancing
along by the side of the way. Altogether it is
the most fascinating, wet and delightful walk
that you could imagine.</p>

<p>Helmut had long been planning an expedition
to these rocks in company with other boy friends,
in order to slay the dragon. He dreamt of it day
and night, until he brought home a bad mark
for "attention" in his school report. He told
his mother about it; she laughed and said he
might leave the poor old fellow alone; there were
plenty of dragons to slay at home, self-will,
disobedience, inattention, and so on! She made
a momentary impression on the little boy, who
always wanted to be good but found it difficult
at times, curious to say, to carry out his
intention.</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful and answered: "Of
course, mother, I know; but this time I want to
slay a 'really and truly' dragon, may I? Will
you let me go with the other boys, it would be
such fun?"</p>

<p>The Dragon's Gorge was not far off, and
mother did not think that Helmut could do
himself any harm, except by getting wet and
dirty, and that he might do as well in the garden
at home.</p>

<p>"If you put on your old suit and your thick
boots, I think you may go. Keep with the other
boys and promise me not to get lost!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, won't it be fine fun! I'll run off
and tell the other fellows. Hurrah!" and Helmut
ran off into the street. Soon four heads were to
be seen close together making plans for the next
day.</p>

<p>"We'll start quite early at six o'clock," they
said, "and take our second breakfast with us."
(In Germany eleven o'clock lunch is called <i>second</i>
breakfast.) However it was seven o'clock a.m.
before the boys had had their first breakfast, and
met outside the house.</p>

<p>How mother and father laughed to see the little
fellows, all dressed in the most warlike costumes
like miniature soldiers, armed with guns and
swords.</p>

<p>Mother was a little anxious and hoped they
would come to no harm; but she liked her boy
to be independent, and knew how happy children
are if left to play their pretence games alone.
She watched the four set off at a swinging march
down the street. Soon they had recruits, for it was
a holiday, and there were plenty of boys about.</p>

<p>Helmut was commanding officer; the boys
shouldered their guns, or presented arms as he
directed. They passed the pond and followed the
stream through the woods, until they came to the
Dragon's Gorge, where the rocks rise up suddenly
high and imposing looking. Here they could
only proceed in single file. Helmut headed the
band feeling as courageous as in his dreams; his
head swam with elation. Huge walls towered
above them; the rocks dropped water on their
heads. As yet they had seen or heard nothing
of the dragon. Yet as they held their breath to
listen, they could hear something roaring under
their feet.</p>

<p>"Don't you tell me that that is only water,"
said Helmut, "A little brook can't make such a
row as that&mdash;that's the dragon."</p>

<p>The other boys laughed, they were sceptical as
to the dragon, and were only pretending, whereas
Helmut was in earnest.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," said one boy, "supposing we
find a dry place and have our lunch!"</p>

<p>They came to where the path wound out again
into the open air, and sat down on some stones,
which could hardly be described as dry. Here
they ate bread and sausage, oranges and bananas.</p>

<p>"Give me the orange peel, you fellows.
Mother hates us to throw it about; it makes the
place so untidy." So saying Helmut pushed his
orange peel right into a crevice of the rock and
covered it with old leaves. But the other boys
laughed at him, and chucked theirs into the little
stream, which made Helmut very angry.</p>

<p>"I won't be your officer any more, if you do
not do as I say," he said, and they began to
quarrel.</p>

<p>"We're not going to fight your old dragon,
we're going home again to play football, that
will be far better fun," said the boys who had
joined as recruits, and they went off home, till
only Helmut's chums were left. They were glad
enough to get rid of the other boys.</p>

<p>"We have more chance of seeing the dragon
without those stupid fellows," they said.</p>

<p>They finished their lunch, shouldered their
guns again, and entered the second gorge, which
is even more picturesque and narrow than the
first.</p>

<p>Suddenly Helmut espied something round, and
slimy, and long lying on the path before him
like a blind worm, but much thicker than blind
worms generally are. He became fearfully excited,
"Come along you fellows, hurry up," he said,
"I do believe it is the dragon's tail!"</p>

<p>They came up close behind him and looked
over his shoulders; the gorge was so narrow here
that they could not pass one another.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" they said, "whatever shall
we do now?"</p>

<p>They all felt frightened at the idea of a real
dragon, but they stood to their guns like men, all
but the youngest, Adolf, who wanted to run away
home; but the others would not let him.</p>

<p>"Helmut catch hold of it, quick now,"
whispered Werner and Wolf, the other two boys.</p>

<p>Helmut stretched out his hand courageously;
perhaps it was only a huge, blind worm after all;
but as he tried to catch it, the thing slipped
swiftly away. They all followed it, running as
fast as they could through the narrow gorge,
bumping themselves against the walls, scratching
themselves and tearing their clothes, but all the
time Helmut never let that tail (if it was a tail)
out of his sight.</p>

<p>"If we had some salt to put on it," said he,
"we might catch it like a dicky bird."</p>

<p>"It would be a fine thing to present to a
museum," said Wolf.</p>

<p>Well, that thing led them a fine dance. It
would stop short, and then when they thought
they had got it, it started off again, until they
were all puffing and blowing.</p>

<p>"We've got to catch it somehow," said
Helmut, who thought the chase fine sport. At
that moment the gorge opened out again into the
woods, and the tail gave them the slip; for it
disappeared in a crevice of the rock where there
was no room for a boy to follow it.</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a blind worm you see," said
Werner.</p>

<p>Presently, however, they heard a noise as of
thunder, and looking down the path they saw a
head glaring at them out of the rocks, undeniably
a dragon's head, with a huge jaw, red tongue,
and rows of jagged teeth.</p>

<p>The boys stared aghast: they were in for an
adventure this time, and no mistake. Slowly the
dragon raised himself out of the rocks, so that
they saw his whole scaly length, like a huge
crocodile. Then he began to move along
the path away from them. He moved quite
slowly now, so there was no difficulty in
keeping up with him; but his tail was so
slimy and slippery that they could not keep
hold of it; moreover it wriggled dreadfully
whenever they tried to seize it. But Helmut
had inherited the cool courage of the Wartburg
knights, and he was not going to be overcome
by difficulties.</p>

<p>With a wild Indian whoop he sprang on the
dragon's back, and all the other boys followed
his example, except little Adolf who was timid
and began to set up a howl for his mother, I'm
sorry to say. No sooner were the boys on his back
than the dragon set off at a fine trot up and down
the Dragon's Gorge, they had to hold on tight
and to duck whenever the rock projected overhead,
or when they went sharply round a corner.</p>

<p>"Hurrah," cried Helmut waving a flag, "this
is better than a motor ride. Isn't he a jolly old
fellow?"</p>

<p>At this remark the jolly old fellow stopped
dead and began to snort out fire and smoke, that
made the boys cough and choke.</p>

<p>"Now stop that, will you!" said Helmut
imperatively, "or we shall have to slay you after
all, that's what we came out for you know." He
pointed his gun at the head of the dragon as he
spoke like a real hero.</p>

<p>The dragon began to tremble, and though they
could only see his profile, they thought he turned
pale.</p>

<p>"Where's that other little boy?" he asked in
a hollow voice. "If you will give him to me
for my dinner, I will spare you all."</p>

<p>Helmut laughed scornfully, "Thanks, old
fellow," he said&mdash;"you're very kind, I'm sure
Adolf would be much obliged to you. I expect
he's run home to his mother long ago; he's a bit
of a funk, we shan't take him with us another
time."</p>

<p>"He looked so sweet and juicy and tender,"
said the dragon sighing, "I never get a child
for dinner nowadays! Woe is me," he sniffed.</p>

<p>"You are an old cannibal," said the boys
horrified, and mistaking the meaning of the word
cannibal. "Hurry up now and give us another
ride, it's first-rate fun this!"</p>

<p>The dragon groaned and seemed disinclined to
stir, but the boys kicked him with their heels,
and there was nothing for it but to gee-up.</p>

<p>After he had been up and down several times,
and the boys' clothes were nearly torn to pieces,
he suddenly turned into a great crevice in the
rocks that led down into a dark passage, and the
boys felt really frightened for the first time.
Daylight has a wonderfully bracing effect on the
nerves.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, a few rays of sunshine
penetrated the black darkness, and they saw that
they were in a small cave. The next thing they
experienced was that the dragon shook himself
violently, and the small boys fell off his back like
apples from a tree on to the wet and sloppy floor.
They picked themselves up again in a second,
and there they saw the dragon before them,
panting after his exertions and filling the cavern
with a poisonous-smelling smoke. Helmut and
Wolf and Werner stood near the cracks which
did the duty of windows, and held their pistols
pointed at him. Luckily he was too stupid to
know that they were only toy guns, and when
they fired them off crack-crack, they soon discovered
that he was in a terrible fright.</p>

<p>"What have I done to you, young sirs?" he
gasped out. "What have I done to you, that
you should want to shoot me? Yet shoot me!
yes, destroy me if you will and end my miserable
existence!" He began to groan until the cavern
reverberated with his cries.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now, old chappie?" said
Helmut, who, observing the weakness of the
enemy, had regained his courage.</p>

<p>"I am an anachronism," said the dragon,
"don't you know what that is?&mdash;well, I am one
born out of my age. I am a survival of anything
but the fittest. <i>You</i> are the masters now, you
miserable floppy-looking race of mankind. <i>You</i>
can shoot me, you can blow me up with dynamite,
you can poison me, you can stuff me&mdash;Oh, oh&mdash;you
can put me into a cage in the Zoological
Gardens, you have flying dragons in the sky
who could drop on me suddenly and crush me.
You have the power. We great creatures of
bygone ages have only been able to creep into the
rocks and caves to hide from your superior cleverness
and your wily machinations. We must perish
while you go on like the brook for ever." So
saying he began to shed great tears, that dropped
on the floor splash, splash, like the water from
the rocks.</p>

<p>The boys felt embarrassed: this was not their
idea of manly conduct, and considerably lowered
their opinion of dragons in general.</p>

<p>"Do not betray me, young sirs," went on the
dragon in a pathetic and weepy voice, "I have
managed so far to lie here concealed though
multitudes of people have passed this way and
never perceived me."</p>

<p>"I tell you what," said Helmut touched by
the dragon's evident terror, "let's make friends
with him, boys; he's given us a nice ride for
nothing; we will present him with the flag of
truce."</p>

<p>Turning to the dragon he said: "Allow us to
give you a banana and a roll in token of our
friendship and esteem."</p>

<p>"O," said the dragon brightening up, "I like
bananas. People often throw the skins away
here. I prefer them to orange peel. I live on
such things, you must know, the cast-off refuse
of humanity," he said, becoming tragic again.</p>

<p>They presented him with the banana, and he ate
it skin and all, it seemed to give him an appetite.
He appeared to recover his spirits, and the boys
thought it would be better to look for the way
out. The cavern seemed quite smooth and round,
except for the cracks through which the daylight
came; they could not discover the passage by
which they had entered. The dragon's eyes were
beginning to look bloodthirsty; remembrances of
his former strength shot across his dulled brains.
He could crush and eat these little boys after
all and nobody would be the wiser. Little boys
tasted nicer than bananas even.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wolf and Werner had stuck their
flags through the holes in the rocks, so that they
were visible from the outside.</p>

<p>Now little Adolf had gone straight home, and
had told awful tales of the games the others were
up to, and he conducted the four mothers to the
Dragon's Gorge where they wandered up and
down looking for their boys. Adolf observed the
flags sticking up on the rocks, and drew attention
to them. The Dragon's Gorge resounded with
the cries of "Helmut! Wolf! Werner!"</p>

<p>The dragon heard the voices as well; his evil
intentions died away; the chronic fear of discovery
came upon him again. He grew paler and paler;
clouds of smoke came from his nostrils, until he
became invisible. At the same moment Helmut
groping against the wall that lay in shadow,
found the opening of the passage through which
they had come. Through this the three boys now
crawled, hardly daring to breathe, for fear of
exciting the dragon again. Soon a gleam of
light at the other end told of their deliverance.
Their tender mothers fell on their necks, and
scolded them at the same time. Truly, never
did boys look dirtier or more disreputable.</p>

<p>"We feel positively ashamed to go home with
you," their mothers said to them.</p>

<p>"Well, for once I was jolly glad you did
come, mother," said Helmut. "That treacherous
old dragon wanted to turn on us after all; he
might have devoured us, if you had not turned up
in the nick of time. Not that I believe that he
<i>really</i> would have done anything of the sort, he
was a coward you know, and when we levelled
our guns at him he was awfully frightened. Still
he <i>might</i> have found out that our guns were not
properly loaded, and then it would have been
unpleasant."</p>

<p>Mother smiled, she did not seem to take the
story quite so seriously as Helmut wished.</p>

<p>"We had a gorgeous ride on his back, mother
dear; would you like to see him? You have
only to lie down flat and squeeze yourself through
that crack in the rocks till you come to his cave."</p>

<p>"No thank you," said mother, "I think I
can do without seeing your dragon."</p>

<p>"Oh, we have forgotten our flags!" called
out Wolf and Werner, "wait a minute for us,"
and they climbed up over the rocks and rescued
the flags. "He's still in there," they whispered
to Helmut in a mysterious whisper.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Helmut that evening when she
came to wish him good night, "do you know,
if you stand up to a dragon like a man, and are
not afraid of him, he is not so difficult to
vanquish after all."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," said mother,
"'Volo cum Deo'&mdash;there is a Latin proverb for
you; it means, that with God's help, will-power
is the chief thing necessary; this even dragons
know. Thus a little boy can conquer even greater
dragons than the monsters vast of ages past."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Helmut musingly, "mother,
dear, I was a real hero to-day, I think you would
have been proud of me; but I must confess
between ourselves, that the old dragon was a bit
of a fool!"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EASTER_HARE" id="THE_EASTER_HARE"></a>THE EASTER HARE</h2>

<p>It is curious how little children of one country
know about the lives and interests of the children
of another. Perhaps if English people would
send their children over to Germany, instead of
their journalists, singers, etc., the danger of an
International war would be lessened. The children
would be sure to fall in love with Germany;
for it is the land above all others that appeals
to children. Women are said to come first in
America, children are certainly the first consideration
in Germany. Froebel's motto: "Come
let us live with our children," is nowhere better
carried out.</p>

<p>A little English girl, named Patsie, came over
to visit her German friends, Gretel and Barbara,
shortly before Easter this year; and she was much
surprised to find all the shop-windows filled with
hares; hares made of chocolate, toy hares, hares
with fine red coats on, hares trundling wheelbarrows
or carrying baskets full of Easter eggs.
Moreover there was no end to the picture post
cards representing the hare in various costumes,
and in some connection with Easter eggs. One
of these post cards represented a hare crawling
out of a large broken egg just like a chicken.</p>

<p>Patsie asked her little friends eagerly what
this all meant.</p>

<p>"Who is the Hare?" she said. "I do so
want to know all about him."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>of course</i>, it is the Easter Hare," they
replied.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you have not heard of
him? O, you <i>poor</i> English children! Why, he
brings us the eggs on Easter Sunday morning!"
said Gretel.</p>

<p>"O don't you know," said Barbara, "he hides
them in the garden, unless it rains or is very wet;
then we have to stay in our bedrooms for fear
of frightening him, and he lays them downstairs
in the dining-room or drawing-room. However,
this has only happened once since I was born,
and I am nine years old; it <i>must</i> be always fine
at Easter."</p>

<p>"We have to let all the blinds down before
he will come into our garden, he is so dreadfully
nervous," said Gretel. "Then he hides the
eggs in the most unexpected places, we have to
hunt and hunt a long time before we have found
them all. Last year we discovered an egg some
weeks afterwards; luckily it was a glass one filled
with sweeties; for if it had been of chocolate, we
could not have eaten it, after it had lain on the
damp mould, where the snails and worms would
have crawled over it. Some of the eggs are made
of chocolate or marzipan or sugar, and some are
real eggs coloured blue or red or brown, or even
sometimes with pictures on them."</p>

<p>"We had two dear little baskets with dollies
in them, and a big Easter Hare made of gingerbread,
as well as the eggs this year," said
Barbara. "We hunt and hunt in every corner
of the garden, and then we divide our treasures
afterwards on two plates, so that is quite fair."</p>

<p>"You are lucky children, why does not the
Hare come to England?" said Patsie. "I am
sure little English children would appreciate
him too!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Gretel answering in verse:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"My dear mother says to me,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;That he will not cross the sea;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;That he fears his eggs would break</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;And his precious goods might shake.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;He's a fairy you must know,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Little Barbara tells you so;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;When he cocks his ears and blinks,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Then of Easter eggs he thinks."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Barbara, "we really
and truly saw him one Easter Sunday morning
when we came back from church, just at the end
of our street, where the gardens join the fields.
He had a friend with him, or perhaps it was Mrs
Easter Hare. They both looked very alarmed
when they saw us, and tore off as fast as they
could scuttle, and hid in the corn-fields. I can't
remember if he had his red coat on, can you,
Gretel?"</p>

<p>"No I don't think he had, he was quietly
dressed in his brown fur suit, with a white tail
to the coat," said Gretel.</p>

<p>Now mother had been puzzled for some time
to think whatever connection there could be
between Easter Day and the Hare, and she could
not find out. But the other day a kind friend
told her: she could never have been able to think
of it herself, it is such a queer reason. The
legend is that as the Hare always sleeps with its
eyes open, it was the only living creature that
witnessed the Resurrection of our Blessed Lord,
and therefore for ever afterwards it has become
associated with Easter.</p>

<p>The Easter egg is easier to account for; the
idea there is, that as the little chicken breaks
through the hard shell, and awakes to new life,
so Christ broke the bars of death on the first
glorious Easter morning. So the simple egg has
become a symbol or sign of a great heavenly
truth. Even little children can understand this
if they think about it, and they will be able to
find out other things too that are symbols in the
same way.</p>

<p>"One year," said Barbara to Patsie, "we
spent Easter Sunday at a farm in the country.
We made beautiful nests of moss all ready for
the Easter Hare. And just when father had
called to us to come out and look for the eggs,
we saw to our disgust that the great pigs with
their dirty old snouts were already hunting for
them, so we rushed down and had to drive them
away first. The geese too seemed to want to join
in the game; it was fine fun, I can tell you. We
filled our pinafores with the eggs."</p>

<p>"When we got home again, we found the
Easter Hare had been there too; so we were finely
spoilt that year," said Gretel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several weeks before Easter this year, before
Patsie came to stay with them, Gretel and
Barbara went for an afternoon walk in the fields
with their father and mother. It was getting
late when they returned; white mists were rising
over the River Nidda, until the trees in the
distance looked like ghosts. There was a strange
feeling in the air, as if something were going to
happen; the children felt excited without knowing
why. Then they suddenly saw a bright light
not far off from them, along the path by the
river. It seemed to revolve, then to change its
position, then it went out altogether. They
thought they saw the crouching form of a man
beside the light; indeed father said that it was
probably a labourer lighting his pipe; but, when
they looked again, it was unmistakably a bush
that had taken a human form in the twilight.
The children instinctively fell back nearer the
grown-ups. There was something creepy about
that bush.</p>

<p>Suddenly a weird cry, shrill and piercing,
broke the silence. It seemed to come from just
in front of them, and sounded awful; as if
a baby were being murdered. The children
clutched hold of father's hand. "It was all
right as long as father and mother were there,"
they thought with the touching confidence of
children.</p>

<p>No one could imagine what it was. The
stretching, ploughed fields on one side could hide
nothing, the little path along the river-bank
was clearly visible. As they approached the
spot whence the crying had seemed to proceed,
all was silent again. Gretel had heard of the
magic flower Moly which screamed when it was
pulled up by the roots; could there be screaming
bushes as well? But the cries had seemed to
come from the ploughed field, not from the
river.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down, the air became darker
and chillier. Suddenly the cry began again;
this time it seemed to proceed directly from an
empty tin lying near them on the ploughed field,
broken and upside down. The children stared
with wide-open eyes at this mysterious old tin:
they could not make head or tail of it, of the
tin I mean.</p>

<p>Then mother stooped and picked up a piece of
egg-shell coloured a beautiful red, that lay on
the path, and held it up triumphantly. "What
do you say to that?" she asked the children.</p>

<p>"Why, it is a piece of a broken Easter egg,
how queer," said the children, "such a long
time before Easter too."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think?" said mother,
almost in a whisper. "I think the Easter Hare
has been along here, perhaps he lives here, and
that tin hides the entrance to his house."</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," said the children. But
at this moment the cries broke out again, coming
just from their very feet it seemed. They
sounded so uncanny that the children did not
dare to move, or to investigate the tin.</p>

<p>"If you disturb him now, you certainly will
not get any Easter eggs this year," said mother.
"He's sure to be very busy painting them just
now, I dare say he cries like that to frighten you
away from his home."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said father, "he can hide
and hold his tongue if he wants to; it is the little
baby hares who make that noise; but just as we
pass by, the mother hare manages to keep them
quiet for a few minutes by giving them something
to put in their little mouths, I expect."</p>

<p>"I <i>would</i> like to see them," said Barbara.</p>

<p>"No, come along, Barbara," said Gretel,
"leave them alone, it would be horrid to get no
Easter eggs wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many nights Barbara dreamt of the Easter
Hare, and at last she made up the following story
about him, which she wrote out beautifully in
flowing German handwriting in an exercise-book.
I thought little English girls and boys
would like to hear a story written by a little
German girl of nine years. So I have translated
it for them here. It will give them a good
idea too of how the Easter Hare is regarded by
German children.</p>

<h3>THE EASTER HARE FAMILY</h3>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">
  <i>Story by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Barbara Arndt</span>
 </p>
</div>

<p>Two children, Paulchen and Luischen, were
wandering about in the country on Easter Day,
they said sorrowfully to one another. "Has
the Easter Hare quite forgotten us this year?"
For three hours they tramped about, and hunted
for eggs in every corner of the fields near the
big forest. Suddenly Paulchen found a huge
egg; he called to Luischen to come at once to see
it, and she trotted along towards him, carrying
a pretty little nest filled with Easter eggs in her
hands, which she had also found.</p>

<p>The children were very happy; it was such a
lovely sunny day, and they were so delighted
with their treasures. However they did not give
up hunting, and soon each of them found an
Easter Hare made of the most delicious chocolate.
Then Luischen discovered an egg which she
called an April-fool's egg; for when she tried to
lick it to see what it tasted like, she found that
it was made of soap.</p>

<p>"O, do come and see what a heap of eggs I've
got," said Paulchen, in tones of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Then little Luischen jumped up, calling out:
"Look, look&mdash;O do come here, quick, quick,
and see those two beautiful big nests filled with
Easter eggs, and two lovely silver baskets beside
them! O how exquisite! The Easter Hare is too
good, he is a darling, did you ever see such
beautiful things as he has given us. I can
hardly hold mine!"</p>

<p>"Neither can I," said Paul, "but look over
there, Luischen, there are two large baskets. I
expect they are meant for us, how very convenient!
We can put all our things into them."</p>

<p>"Let's go and fetch them at once," said
Luischen. "Do you see that pretty bush with
silver palm-buds on it over there?" she continued,
"we will go and pick a few twigs from
it and tie them on to our baskets with some grass;
then they will look more 'Eastery.'"</p>

<p>"If only we knew where the Easter Hare
lives," they said somewhat sadly, "we would go
and call on him at once and thank him for all
his kindness to us."</p>

<p>"O but just look, Paulchen," said Luischen
excitedly, "there is something written on the
rocks over there; perhaps the Easter Hare lives
there. Paulchen, you can read a little, do see
if you can make out what is written."</p>

<p>Paulchen read:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"I am the Master Easter Hare</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Lay eggs, in plenty, everywhere."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>"Come along, run, we will knock at the
door," said Luischen joyfully. So they went up
to the rock and knocked.</p>

<p>"Come in," said a clear voice.</p>

<p>They went in and turned to the door on the right
from which the voice had come. They entered
a comfortable room, and there on a cosy easy-chair,
there sat father Easter Hare, who had just
put on his spectacles to examine the eggs which
his son, who was about seven years old, had
painted.</p>

<p>"Good morning, dear Mr Easter Hare, we
have come to thank you for the lovely eggs,"
said the children.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear, dear</i>," said Mr Easter Hare, "you
found them of course in your garden, or&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no, we have no home, we are orphans;
the people in the orphanage did not treat us
kindly, so we ran away, and meant to seek our
fortune in the wide world," said the children.
"Then we were so lucky as to find these beautiful
eggs in the fields over there!"</p>

<p>"Dear me, so you are orphans!&mdash;well then
perhaps you would like to stay here with us and
learn painting and housekeeping," said Mr
Easter Hare.</p>

<p>"Oh yes indeed, we should simply love to!"
answered the children, "but where is your wife?
Perhaps she will be able to teach us to be of some
use in the household."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my wife is in the kitchen cooking
cabbage, and carrots, and making a famous
salad."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said both the children, "may we
help her dress the salad?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my wife will be very pleased to
find that you can be so useful; there, just
opposite in the passage, is a door that leads into
the kitchen where my wife is busy."</p>

<p>The children followed his directions and went
into the kitchen, and there sat Mrs Easter
Hare.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs Easter Hare," said the
children politely, curtsying and bowing, "we
have come to help you in the household, and to
stay with you till we are grown up; but now
please let us make the salad."</p>

<p>"Well, that is very kind of you, I'm sure, to
want to help me," said Mrs Easter Hare, and
the children set to work at once.</p>

<p>After this the children helped her every day
in the kitchen in the morning, and in the afternoon
they learnt from father Easter Hare how
to paint the eggs smoothly and prettily, and how
to read and write; for the Easter Hare is
educated, you must know, and far more intelligent
than ordinary hares. When they grew up
and went out into the world again, Paulchen
became a celebrated artist and lived in the artist
colony at Cronberg, and little Luischen married,
and became an exemplary housewife; but their
best friends throughout their lives were always</p>

<h3>MR AND MRS EASTER HARE.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="THE_NIXY_LAKE" id="THE_NIXY_LAKE"></a>THE NIXY LAKE</h2>

<p>In one of the wildest and most romantic parts
of Germany, there is a high mountain which is
as renowned for the strange stories that are told
about it, as for its many natural peculiarities.
It is flat on the top, falling off precipitously on
every side. In recent times a high tower has
been built on the very edge of the rock. Curious
to say, the ground on the summit of this mountain
is a bog or morass; flat slabs of stone have
been placed on it to enable bold tourists to reach
the tower without sinking in unawares. There
is a bronze ring on a balcony surrounding the
tower, with darts pointing in different directions,
showing where London, Paris, and St Petersburg,
for instance, are situated. I need hardly say that
these towns are not visible, but that if a straight
line could be drawn from this spot, it would
reach them.</p>

<p>Not far below the summit there is a mysterious-looking
lake, which it is strange indeed to find
at so high a level. A huge cliff formed of
boulders of rock rises on the one side of the lake;
it falls like a great wall straight into the water;
only daring little ferns and plants have a
foothold on it; the lake is inaccessible from this
direction. A narrow pathway winding in and
out edged with water-reeds leads by it on the
other side. This lake is said to be so deep that
it is unfathomable; it is dark brown in colour,
bitter and brackish to the taste. No fish can
live in it. Learned men, called geologists, who
study the crust of the earth, have decided that
this region is not volcanic in origin as it would
appear at first sight, but that the lake is fed by
water from the morass.</p>

<p>This mountain is constantly visited by sudden
violent atmospheric disturbances, great winds
and heavy thunderstorms, that spring up at a
moment's notice, striking terror into the hearts
of any travellers who may be caught in them.</p>

<p>Now several centuries ago, before the time
of railways and steamboats, a mighty king
of the water-sprites lived in this lake with his
three beautiful daughters, the famed nixies of the
lake.</p>

<p>The King was a majestic old man with long
white beard and hair; his eyes were black and
sinister, and when he drew his eyebrows together
in a straight line over his eyes, his frown was
terrible to behold. The thunderstorms which
devastated the country round, were attributed to
him. In his fits of rage, the village folk declared,
he would hurl stones and thunderbolts down
from the mountain, heedless of what or whom he
might destroy.</p>

<p>The day would be fine, the sky blue, and in a
moment a storm wind would arise, clouds would
cover the heavens, and lightning shoot forth;
how could this be accounted for by natural
agency?</p>

<p>The nixies were much to be pitied, if the truth
were known, for their father was a stern old
tyrant, and interfered constantly with their
harmless amusements, also prohibiting their
leaving the lake to frolic at midnight with the
wood-spirits, whom he considered as beneath
them in rank.</p>

<p>On a warm day in the lovely month of June
(which is the favourite month of all the year for
the water-nixies, for then the white and yellow
water lilies are in flower, and the yellow irises
shine among the water-reeds) the three sisters
were swimming lazily to and fro, plunging under
the water like seals, to reappear like seals on the
look-out for something to happen. But nothing
ever did happen but one of their father's
tempers, and of these they were tired enough as
you may imagine. They had not fishes' tails
like their cousins the mermaids, but slender
limbs of dazzling whiteness. Their hair resembled
beautiful seaweed as they dived under the water,
or when it spread out like a fan on the surface.</p>

<p>The eldest, Clothilde, was dark; she was
beautiful, but haughty, and looked as if she had
inherited her father's temper.</p>

<p>The youngest was very fair; she had the golden
hair of a fairy, her eyes were blue, but meaningless;
there was little sense in their depths. Her
name was Elfrida.</p>

<p>The second sister, Lenore, was of a different
type, and might have been mistaken for a mortal
maiden. Her hair was neither dark nor fair,
neither red nor brown, it was of a pale hazel
colour and fell in straight masses nearly to her
feet. Her eyes were of a deep grey fringed with
dark lashes; they had a mysterious and pathetic
look&mdash;a look caused by longing after something
indefinite and yet desired, or by a prescience
perhaps of coming disaster.</p>

<p>Lenore rose to the surface of the water.
"Sisters," she called, "sisters, listen to me,"
and she swam towards the shade of the rock, and
seated herself on a stony seat, half in half out
of the water. "I can bear the monotony of our
existence no longer. I tire of this life of ceaseless
dancing, swimming, drifting. I want to
visit the homes of men who live in the village
that lies below us at the foot of the mountain,
to hear stories of the world from which we are
shut out, to share as far as it is possible for
us in the simple and homely amusements of
mortals."</p>

<p>"I am willing to go with you," said Clothilde,
frowning discontentedly. "I am tired too of
this melancholy lake; the eternal nothingness of
our life oppresses me too." She tore a water-lily
to pieces as she spoke.</p>

<p>"O do not do that!" said Lenore, almost as
if in pain, "the flowers can feel too!"</p>

<p>"What if they can!" said Clothilde scornfully;
for the cruelty of the nixies coursed
through her veins.</p>

<p>"And you Elfrida," said Lenore, turning to
her fairer sister, "will you come with us?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Elfrida, "I prefer to stay here
among the water-lilies. I have no aspirations, I
could live here for ever sleeping through the
winter months, dreaming through the summer
ones, yet if you go, I will go too; for we three
have never been separated, and I should be afraid
if I were left alone with my father." As she
spoke she placed a water-lily in her golden hair;
the sunbeams struck through the fir-trees by the
lake and fell on her, till she looked like some
wonderful fairy princess, too exquisite to be
real.</p>

<p>A young man happened to be passing the lake
just at this moment; he caught the entrancing
picture as if it were a vision from Heaven; his
brain reeled, his breath failed him, he would
have fallen in a swoon; but then he met Lenore's
eyes, grave, calm, and searching. A wild longing
and deep melancholy seized on him. He
rushed towards the lake, and clutched hold of
the branches of a young willow, only just in
time to prevent himself from falling into those
treacherous depths.</p>

<p>With a weird cry and their white arms raised
over their heads, the nixies disappeared in the
lake. The young man gazed as one bewitched;
crossed himself in fear; and gazed again. All
was silent: no living creature stirred; only the
sunbeams fell athwart the lake, and little cascades
of water fell over the surface of the rock.</p>

<p>"I have seen the nixies of the pool," thought
the young man, who was the son of a rich
peasant farmer in the village. "Surely that
means that I shall die ere long. I should not
fear death," he continued, "if I were to die in
battle in honourable and open conflict; but to die
young, stricken by some awful and unaccountable
fate, that would be terrible."</p>

<p>As he turned homewards, a wind arose that
nearly hurled him into the lake; so violent was
the gust, and a storm burst forth, the like of
which he had never experienced before. Branches
were torn from the trees, and hurled in his path;
the lightning was continuous and nearly blinded
him. Glancing fearfully back at the lake, the
waters seemed to have arisen in great waves, and
he thought he saw the nixy King himself raging
and roaring like a wild creature, casting the
storm winds forth from their fortresses in the
rocks, holding the lightning like fireworks in his
long fingers, and hurling it across the land.
Terrified, half-stunned by the thunder, and
stupefied by the hail and rain, he at last reached
home, where his mother awaited him in great
anxiety. However he soon had off his wet, torn
clothes, and casting himself on his bed fell into
a profound slumber. He slept for nearly a night
and a day, and when he awoke his adventures
seemed to him a wild dream, and like a dream
were half-forgotten although they exerted a
subtle influence on his waking thoughts that he
was unaware of.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nixies, and especially Lenore,
had been anxious as to his fate. Not until she
had sent their dwarf messenger into the village
to make inquiries as to his welfare, could she be
at rest. Her wish to visit the homes of men
became a passion, a burning desire that could
not be quenched. She called on her dread
father; three times she cried out to him, and her
sisters echoed the call. Then he arose from the
depths, majestic and so terrible to behold that
Lenore almost lost the courage to address him.
But he listened to her request in silence,
brooding, while great ravens whirled and
swooped in the sky above their heads. Then he
spoke:</p>

<p>"It is decreed that no one can alter the path
of fate, or avoid the doom that is written in the
stars. The hour has come: I have foreseen this
day; go, my daughters, go. But remember there
is one condition which you must strictly obey.
One night in the week you may be absent from
the lake; but as the hour strikes twelve, you
must be back again in these waters. I shall
send a messenger to fetch you, the dwarf Hunold,
beware lest you keep him waiting! If you
disobey, destruction will overtake you, and your
home will know you no more." He sank gloomily
into the lake; the day was oppressive; no rain
fell and the evening brought no relief. Strange
and uneasy were the dreams of many that night
in the little village.</p>

<p>Some young people returning late from a
social gathering, reported that they had seen a
bright, uncanny light in the sky, like a fire, or
some said like a golden hand, at midnight over
the ill-omened mountain.</p>

<p>In those days when it was so difficult to travel
from place to place, the villagers were obliged to
depend on themselves for amusement and entertainment.
In the villages round about the
mountain it was the custom for the young people
to meet together at each other's houses on
Saturday evenings. Those who had rooms large
enough, took it in turns to invite all the rest;
the girls brought their spinning-wheels, and the
room where they met was called the spinning-room.
The girls were busy and merry at the
same time. Stories were told, and songs were
sung, the young men smoked and drank wine,
and not infrequently the spinning-wheels were
cleared away and there was dancing. Strangers
were welcome; for the peasants were renowned
for their hospitality; but seldom did it happen
that travellers passed that way; some young
fellow perhaps might drop in who was wandering
about for a year or so before settling down to the
work of his life as the German custom is; but
tourists were few when roads were bad and money
scarce.</p>

<p>One lovely summer's evening at the end of
June the full moon was shining in the sky, the
latticed windows of the peasant's house where the
young folk were assembled, were wide open; the
air was laden with the scent of the white lilies
and roses that grew in the garden at the back of
the cottage. There was no light as yet but that
of the moon in the parlour; the spinning-wheels
too were silent; for stories were being told; one
more marvellous than the other, of ghosts and
goblins, of dwarfs and mountain-spirits, and
naturally enough awful tales of the neighbouring
nixy King, and of his three daughters who lived
in the enchanted lake.</p>

<p>Hermann, the young man who had been
overtaken by the thunderstorm, was present this
evening; he was silent and glum, though the
most charming village maidens chaffed him and
tried to captivate him, and the peasant girls in
this part of Germany are renowned for their
beauty and their grace. The melancholy which
was not so much part of his natural disposition
as due to the adventures of that evening, fell on
him again like a dark cloud oppressing his brain.
The girls who had been listening to the stories,
were by this time worked up to a state of feeling
which can only be described by the words
creepy, or eerie. Most of them experienced that
unaccountable sensation which Germans call
G&auml;nsehaut (goose-flesh). So that a sudden
knock at the door caused them to cry out in fear
and clutch hold of their sweethearts. The
knock was repeated three times before anyone
summoned up courage to open the door. Then
the assembled company fell back in astonishment
as three beautiful young girls entered the room,
each holding a spinning-wheel under her arm.
They walked erect like princesses, everyone was
sure they must be of high rank. They wore
dresses of some shimmering material such as the
village folk had never seen before, and necklaces
of pearls, silken hose and silver shoes.</p>

<p>Hermann's heart beat to bursting as he beheld
them: where had he seen them before? Surely
they were the nixies of the magic pool, and his
doom had fallen upon him. Never, never, had
he been able to forget Lenore's eyes. Their
mournful beauty haunted his dreams. He met
them now, as his breath came and went in great
gasps; and there was a flash of recognition
between them. "What heavenly beauty, what
a noble air she has," he thought, hardly regarding
her sisters who were strictly speaking far
more beautiful.</p>

<p>The three nixies, for of course it was they, put
forth all their fascinating arts to ingratiate
themselves with the young people assembled
there.</p>

<p>"You are pleased to see us, are you not?"
they said. "We have heard of the fame of your
spinning-evenings, and have come from a far
country to take part in them. You shall see how
we can spin."</p>

<p>"Very gratifying for us, I am sure," murmured
the officiating president of the club.</p>

<p>"Now do not let us disturb you, you were
telling stories I believe as we entered," said
Lenore, who, being the most human, took the
lead in the conversation.</p>

<p>But no one dared to open his mouth, even
those who had been the most eager to narrate
wild tales before, seemed stricken with dumbness
now.</p>

<p>"You could tell us a story, I believe," she
said, turning to Hermann, who could only shake
his head. "Then I must tell one myself," she
said with a little sigh. She poured forth an
extraordinary story to which the peasants listened
open-mouthed, the tale of a terrible doom that
overtook a faithless lover.</p>

<p>"A mortal man," she said, "had made love
to a beautiful nixy, and won her affection in
return. But because she was not human, he did
not think of marrying her, but became engaged
to a village maiden who was good and sweet, if
not so beautiful as the nixy. But the nixy had
her revenge. She swam under the bridge where
the little river ran through the fields, and one
day as the two were walking in the dewy
meadows, she caused the waters to rise suddenly
in a great flood, and tore her lover away from
his human bride down with her in the stream,
choking him under the water till he was dead.
Then she sat with his head on her lap, and
stroked his beautiful dark curls, and wept until
she dissolved in tears, and became part of the
water, which has been slightly salt from that
day. The village maiden was married to a rich
old peasant not long afterwards; so much for
human fidelity," said Lenore, fixing her sad eyes
on Hermann.</p>

<p>"He well-deserved his fate," said Hermann,
"who chose the lesser when he might have had
the greater love."</p>

<p>"I think the nixy was a mean, wicked thing,"
said a young girl, almost a child, called
Brigitte, with soft, dark eyes, and a sweet
expression on her face. "She could not really
have cared for her lover, or she would have
wanted him to be happy with the village girl,
as she knew she could not marry him herself."</p>

<p>"Never," said Hermann, excitedly, whose
blood was coursing like fire in his veins, "better
death in the arms of the beloved, than a contented
life with lower aims!"</p>

<p>The men laughed.</p>

<p>"Now who would have thought that Hermann
was so romantic!" they said. "And he has
the fattest pigs and the biggest casks of wine in
the village!"</p>

<p>Songs were proposed; everyone joined in; the
voices of the nixies were heard above all, clear
and beautiful as a bell. They began with one
of the best-known songs in the German language
which is always sung on especially jovial
occasions, it begins:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poemt">
<tr><td align="left">"I cannot tell why or wherefore</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="ind1">A legend of olden times</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Deep in my heart is singing,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="ind1">In mournful rhythmic rhymes."</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>After several songs had been sung in unison,
Hermann begged the young man who was the
host that evening to ask the beautiful strangers
to sing a song alone and of their own choosing,
he longed to hear their voices, unspoilt by those
of others.</p>

<p>The nixy maidens readily complied: was not
singing their most natural mode of expressing
themselves? They sang these verses to a weird,
haunting melody:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"The wild-fowl are calling: come back to the lake!</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;O nixies come back, or your proud hearts must break;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;The moonbeams are glancing, the fairies are dancing,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Come back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;The grey mists are rising! Beware, O beware!</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;For though you are slender and though you are fair,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Your treacherous waters, O nixy king's daughters,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Can slay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Beware the king's anger&mdash;O tempt not your fate,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;The white water-lilies your coming still wait;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Wide open each flower until the twelfth hour&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Beware!"</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The old pendulum clock on the wall struck
eleven. How fast the time had flown! The
three beautiful maidens rose up hastily and
departed, wishing a courteous "good night"
and "good luck to you" to the company.</p>

<p>As Hermann opened the door for them, he saw
a little dwarf with a lighted lantern waiting for
them outside the door, and much as he wished
to accompany them home, he did not dare to
do so.</p>

<p>When they had left the room, a storm of
conjecture burst forth; at last everyone agreed
that they must be the nixies of the lake.</p>

<p>"We did not like the look of their eyes; they
were so cold and treacherous," said some of the
girls who were jealous of a beauty that they felt
they could never attain to.</p>

<p>"You are ill-natured things, not fit to sweep
the floor for such exquisite creatures," said
Hermann angrily; and the whole company began
to jeer and to laugh at him, saying:</p>

<p>"Hermann has fallen in love with the nixies.
Many a wet kiss will he have from them&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!&mdash;but
cold water will be his bridal bed, and
death the groomsman&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Do not be so cruel," said kind little Brigitte,
who had blamed the nixy in the story. "See
how pale Hermann looks, he will faint in another
minute; he has never been strong since he was
out in that awful storm."</p>

<p>Hermann could bear the conversation no
longer; hastily saying good night he went home
with wild thoughts in his head, and, alas! wild,
ungovernable love in his heart.</p>

<p>For the next few weeks on Saturday evenings
the same thing happened. There was the usual
social gathering, no one was absent; the little
room could hardly hold the thronging guests.
Then there was the eagerly looked for knock at
the door, and the three lovely maidens entered
and shared so naturally in what was going on
that the young people gradually lost somewhat
of their awe of them. Who could spin so fast
and so finely as the three strangers; who could
sing such entrancing songs; who could tell more
wonderful stories!</p>

<p>Hermann generally managed to sit by Lenore,
and to hold her hand, and he knew his love was
returned.</p>

<p>Naturally the exquisite Elfrida, and the
stately Clothilde had their admirers as well.</p>

<p>"Soon they will have taken all our sweethearts
away from us, the nasty creatures," whispered
some of the village girls under their breath,
"and they cannot marry all the lads in the
country round. The men are bewitched, that is
certain&mdash;no good can come of it. Most of the
men realise it, however, and will come back to
us in time; all except Hermann. He is so far
gone that it is quite hopeless to try and influence
him."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for Lenore," said little Brigitte,
"I would do anything I could to help her; she
looks so <i>very</i> unhappy!"</p>

<p>On the night of the 9th of September the
spinning evening was to be at Hermann's house,
which was a splendid building in its way, like
a great wooden castle. He was feverish with
excitement. He bought and gathered all the
flowers he could get together, and decked the
house as for a wedding-feast. His mother could
not bake cakes that were fine enough to suit his
taste; the furniture seemed to him clumsy and
old-fashioned. He would gladly have strewn
rose-leaves, instead of rushes, on the floor for his
lady-love to tread on. All the time a voice was
telling him to desist: that such love could never
be hallowed; that his bride was but a myth,
a dream that would vanish away. His mother
was terribly troubled about him, and feared that
the boy had lost his wits in the thunderstorm.</p>

<p>"You shall see my bride to-night, mother,"
he said. "Ah, there is no one like her!"</p>

<p>But the old woman trembled and shook and
crossed herself, she knew not why. She felt a
presentiment of coming evil.</p>

<p>"She shall not escape from me so soon
to-night," thought Hermann to himself. "I
know what I will do: I shall put the clock an
hour back, so that when it is really twelve
o'clock, they will think it is only eleven. One
hour, one blessed hour more in her company,
snatched in defiance of fate!"</p>

<p>Never had Hermann been more charming as
a host than he was to-night. He bade his guests
heartily welcome and shook them warmly by the
hand. True, he was somewhat distracted and
gave strange answers to questions that were put
to him. His eyes were constantly on the door.
It opened at last, and the three entered; they
looked lovelier than ever; they had on golden
shoes and wore golden girdles. Their dresses
were white edged with pale green like water-lilies
with a green calyx. There was to be no
spinning to-night. Hermann had provided for
music and dancing; he became giddy and his
senses failed him almost at the thought of
dancing with the lovely Lenore.</p>

<p>Ah what light little feet! They hardly seemed
to touch the ground as they flew round; but the
time too sped by with great rushing wings,
though Hermann had striven to check its headlong
course. They paid no heed to the dwarf and his
constant warning taps on the door; the three
sisters were too engrossed in the delights of the
dance. But suddenly Lenore glanced at the
clock; it pointed to eleven.</p>

<p>"A few moments more, my belov&egrave;d," she said,
"and then we must part. But why are you
so pale?" she asked of Hermann, whose heart
was beating fast enough to suffocate him; for
he was afraid now of the consequences of his
deed.</p>

<p>"Lenore," he said chokingly, "it is midnight;
I hope I have not done wrong. I put
back the clock. I wanted to keep you all
longer at my house."</p>

<p>Lenore turned deadly pale, then she told her
sisters of the fatal trick that Hermann had
played on them, and they too turned white as the
chalk on the walls; well they knew their father
and what his revenge might be!</p>

<p>Murmuring a sad farewell Lenore gazed for the
last time in Hermann's eyes, and then the dark
night swallowed her up for ever.</p>

<p>The dwarf's lantern could be seen from time to
time among the forest trees like a will-o'-the-wisp;
then that too vanished.</p>

<p>The dancing and feasting went on for some
time; but Hermann's heart was sick within him;
he had no spirit left for the revelry. An
indescribable feeling of terror and anxiety
possessed him. The clock struck twelve; the
guests dispersed. They had hardly left the
house when a terrific storm broke forth, appalling
in its awful violence; the house shook, trees were
uprooted, lightning blazed continually. The
tempest was nothing, however, compared to that
in Hermann's breast; he could not rest or sleep;
fearful visions assailed him: he seemed to hear
his beloved Lenore calling him, or begging for
mercy from her cruel father.</p>

<p>Towards morning the storm had somewhat
abated though it was by no means over. Hermann
rushed out of the house, taking a wild
pleasure in battling with the fierce elements. Up
and up with a certain step he went towards that
lake where all his anguish had begun, and yet
where all his hopes and desires were centred.
As he approached the lake through the fir-wood,
the sky over the great cliff was rosy in the early
dawn, the birds were singing, the harebells
raised their dew-drenched heads and looked at
him. No motion&mdash;no sound&mdash;the lake was cruel
it seemed to him in its indifference to his grief.
"Lenore," he cried, "Lenore!"</p>

<p>Then the waters of the lake stirred and three
waves arose, each one greater than the last, and
in the third was the nixy king with a cruel
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Ah, call for Lenore," he said mockingly,
"but you will never see her again!&mdash;Behold, the
doom of the disobedient daughters is fulfilled."
As he spoke the lake stirred again, the waters
whirled round, three exquisite rose-leaves rose
from the depths of the lake and floated on the
surface of the water. "Never again will you or
any mortal man behold the nixies of the pool;
they are changed into rose-leaves; this was their
punishment," he said, "a poetical punishment&mdash;ha,
ha!" and he vanished with a tremendous
clap of thunder.</p>

<p>More than half-mad Hermann stumbled home;
for weeks he lingered between life and death.</p>

<p>The kind little Brigitte would have liked to
have taken care of him, and would have made
him a good wife; but because of his consuming
love for Lenore, he slowly pined away, until one
day he was found lying dead beside the fatal
lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="KING_REINHOLD" id="KING_REINHOLD"></a>KING REINHOLD</h2>

<p>There are villages in the heart of the Taunus
Mountains that are little altered by this progressive
age; no railway, not even the post-chaise
reaches them, and motor-cars are only to be seen
as they whirr past occasionally on the high road.</p>

<p>Such a village is Elhalten; it lies in a green
valley, rich with many flowers; a lovely little
brook runs through it, disappearing suddenly
under houses to reappear again triumphant
farther down the road. This brook is called the
Silber Bach or Silver Brook, on account of the
clearness of its water. On either side of the
valley rise up steep mountain-slopes with wild
woods and rough pathways. One good road joins
the village with Vockenhausen, and so with the
well-known town of Eppstein.</p>

<p>On the farther side of the K&uuml;ppel (the steep
peak that rises behind Elhalten) is a forester's
cottage, a lonely and deserted-looking dwelling
in the middle of the forest. There I once nursed
a huge friendly cat who was so delighted to see
a stranger that she quite persecuted me with her
affection.</p>

<p>On the top of the K&uuml;ppel is an airy tower;
anyone who wishes to try what flying is like, and
cannot afford to go in the Zeppelin airship, can
form an idea of it here. There is a most
expansive view of the Taunus Range, and very
little underneath the feet.</p>

<p>In the forester's hut lived a little boy named
Hugo. He was the son of the forester, a fine
little fellow of nearly six years. Hugo had
few story-books; but he did not need them; for
he lived in the forest, and the forest tells its own
tales to the children who live there. The birds
would chatter to him, and tell him their family
histories; the silent, sweet-eyed deer came to the
forestry to be fed in the cold winter, and so he
learnt to know their ways. The little flowers
would whisper tales of the strange sights they
had seen in the forest, when they had by chance
forgotten to close their petals for the night.</p>

<p>Hugo had seen much for a five year's old boy;
but he longed to see more. He had heard stories
of wood-goblins, of fairies and nixies, and of the
busy dwarfs who live underground. He thirsted
for adventure.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you that just about this time
the news had come from Elhalten that a child
had been lost from the village, a dear little girl
of four years. She had strayed by herself in
the woods of the K&uuml;ppel, and though her parents
and Hugo's father, indeed all the villagers had
sought for her, no trace could they find, save
strips of her little blue pinafore, and a hair
ribbon on the brambles in a remote spot near
an old quarry. You can imagine what a stir
this made in the quiet life of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Some people spoke of gipsies, some of deep
holes or pools in the woods; others did not say
much, but they thought of the wood-spirits and
fairies and shook their heads. Hugo had many
a time played with pretty baby Elsa; her father
and the forester were friends, and she had spent
the day sometimes in the forestry on the K&uuml;ppel.
You may imagine that the children were more
strictly watched over than usual. Hugo's mother
kept a sharp eye on him; for she knew that
his little head was full of all sorts of queer
notions.</p>

<p>It happened that, about a fortnight after these
events, Hugo's father went out for a night's
hunting. His mother had been busy all the
afternoon; the weather was hot and sultry. At
last drowsiness overcame her and she fell asleep
with her head on the kitchen table. Now she
was certainly not given to falling asleep in the
afternoon, she was generally much too busy for
that; so I really think she must have been
bewitched. The fairies sometimes put sleeping
draughts into people's coffee; then it is all up
with them.</p>

<p>Now was Hugo's opportunity. He hastily
took up the brown (or grey as it is called in Germany)
rye-bread and sausage that stood ready
for his supper, packed it into a beautiful green
case, with two May-bugs painted on it, snatched
up his toy gun in case of accidents, and set out
with a brave heart to look for little Elsa.</p>

<p>I must tell you that he had dreamt of her
repeatedly since her disappearance. She seemed
to look at him with her wistful blue eyes, and
to implore his help. A rhyme rang constantly
in his head that seemed to have reference to her;
but he could not quite make out what it meant:
</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"King Reinhold found a little maid</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Alone within the forest glade;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;She wept and cried in sore distress,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;All torn and tattered was her dress;</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;He gave her playthings for her own.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;But still she wept the livelong day,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;She would not laugh, and would not play.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">'This is most tiresome to behold;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;What shall I do?' said King Reinhold."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The little maid was probably Elsa; but where
was she? Who was King Reinhold? How
could Hugo deliver her? He could not answer
these questions. "I must trust to luck, and
hope that the fairies will help me. Heigho for
adventures!"</p>

<p>It was the twilight hour; the sky was of a
delicate grey-green tint, the birds called to their
roving mates to come home to bed, a few faint
stars appeared in the sky; mystery hung in the air.</p>

<p>On Hugo went&mdash;following a circle of green
and gold that was marked on the trees and
seemed to show him the way. He sang and
shouted merrily to keep up his spirits; it was
supper-time, and the night air had made him
hungry; so he unpacked his bread and sausage
and made a good meal. The moon had risen,
and threw a glimmer of light through the trees;
the lingering shades of twilight vanished.
On one side of the little path was the dark
fir-wood, impenetrable in its gloom, on the other,
beeches and oaks. Little harebells, and pink
<ins title="original has centuary">centaury</ins> bordered the pathway. There was a
lovely woody smell in the late summer night, a
smell of damp earth, and fungi and flowers, or
rather a combined perfume still more subtle and
indescribable.</p>

<p>The stillness and loneliness began to oppress
our hero a little for the first time. If he had
been a town child he would have been horribly
frightened long before this; but he was as used
to the silence of the woods, as you may be to the
noise and bustle of the street.</p>

<p>Suddenly a muffled sound broke the silence:
knock, knock, knock, like the blow of hammers
when the workmen are busy at some distance.
Hugo's brave little heart began to beat; for he
knew that the noise must be made by the Kobolds
at work on their anvils deep underground.</p>

<p>Then he was aware of footsteps behind him:
tramp, tramp, tramp. Was it his father come to
fetch him home? He rather hoped that it might
be so; but when he plucked up courage to turn
round, there was no one there! An owl screeched;
a bush rustled near him; he turned round sharply,
and there he saw a little old man with a huge
key in his hand sitting on a felled tree-trunk.
His bright blue eyes gleamed strangely in the
moonshine, and his shaggy grey hair stood up on
either side of his red-peaked cap. He wore a jacket
of green, lined with scarlet, and had on heavy
wooden shoes such as the peasants wear in some
parts of Germany. He plucked a dandelion clock
that grew by the way and held it up to the moon.</p>

<p>"One, two, three," up to nine the little man
counted.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock! Come along hurry up," said
he, and he took Hugo by the hand.</p>

<p>Instantly the child was able to see many things
in the forest which he had not observed before;
strange fairy forms came floating by and gazed
at him with sad, sweet eyes; then a stream of
laughing elves passed him in wild frolic. Yes,
once he thought that through the trees he saw
the gigantic form of the Old King himself,
throned on his mountain.</p>

<p>Down, down a narrow bypath they clambered,
over stones and through brambles, and interlaced
branches. Then they crossed a trout stream silver
clear in the moonlight. The trout were asleep; but
when the dwarf leant over the little stone bridge
and whispered a few words&mdash;flash and they were
off, far far down the stream; they hid under the
rushes and tree-roots by the banks and quaked for
fear. They dreaded the dwarfs and with reason.</p>

<p>"Boiled trout with a fine butter sauce, that
is my favourite dish," said the little man to
Hugo and smacked his lips greedily.</p>

<p>They walked along the beautifully overshadowed
pathway by the trout stream, watching
the moonlight on the rippling water, till they left
the brook behind, and came to a green meadow
in the centre of which stood a venerable oak-tree,
which still bore green leaves though its trunk
was completely hollow.</p>

<p>The tree was lit from within by a brilliant
glow of rosy light. The dwarf approached on
tiptoe, taking off his clumsy shoes, and beckoning
to Hugo to follow him quietly. They peeped
through the holes in the trunk of the tree, and
O what a sight they saw!</p>

<p>Twenty or more of the tiniest children, scarcely
bigger than my finger, sat or danced or rolled on
the green mossy carpet of the tree-room. These
were the fairy babies, and this was the fairies'
nursery. Each little girl had a dolly made of
the loveliest flowers, and a cradle of green oak
leaves, sewed together by grass blades.</p>

<p>The tiny Fee babies lay on their backs and
kicked and crowed for joy, and the biggest of all
the fairies present gave them their bottles, filled
with moonshine and honey-dew on which the
babies thrive. The boy elves made the most
noise; they had captured a field mouse, a huge
creature it seemed in comparison with them, and
they were all trying to ride on its back at once.</p>

<p>Hugo was so delighted with the lovely sight
that he could not resist calling out "Oh!" in
tones of ecstasy. In an instant, puff! the light
went out; a cold fog arose; Hugo saw his dwarf
companion change into a big black bear terrible
to behold. Just as our hero thought he was
going to be eaten up, the Kobold resumed his
natural form.</p>

<p>"Be silent if you would be wise," he said, and
that was all.</p>

<p>They followed the little pathway further
through the meadow and into the woods again,
until they came suddenly on a great pile of rocks,
picturesquely heaped up amongst the trees, such
as are so common in the Taunus Mountains.
The dwarf went up to the rock, key in hand, and
searched about until he had found a secret door.
Then he fitted the key into the lock and turned
it, then tugged and tugged to open the door.
Suddenly it swung open, creaking noisily, and
the dwarf lay on his back. Up he got grumbling
and scolding. "They ought to have oiled the
hinges, the lazy louts," he said.</p>

<p>As the door opened, Hugo saw a long corridor
before him, lit by stars of light, and countless
mirrors reflected the stars in every direction. The
effect was rather too dazzling after the dark night,
and Hugo's eyes blinked. Down, down, down, the
corridor gradually descended and seemed never-ending.
"However shall I get out again?"
thought Hugo anxiously. He did not know you
see that there are many ways out of magic land.</p>

<p>At last they came to another door, made of
crystal glass, and entered a large hall with a
sparkling roof of rock crystal. In the centre was
a fountain, a more wonderful creation fairyland
does not contain. Hugo held his breath for
fear of saying "Oh!" again. Strange gnomes
and fairies seemed to be alive in it, and the
element it contained, was not water, but fire. The
most marvellous display of fireworks that you
have ever seen, would be nothing in comparison.</p>

<p>Sometimes it illustrated well-known fairy tales:
Snowdrop in her glass coffin, Cinderella trying on
the shoe and so on. Hugo could have watched
it for ages, and left it reluctantly, looking back
all the time. Then they passed through an
arched doorway, and a new scene met their view.</p>

<p>Multitudes of little dwarf men dressed in
Court attire stood round the room. Facing them,
on a throne of gold, with a tiny crown of gold
starred with bright-eyed diamonds on her head
sat a real little human girl, with a shabby old
dolly in her arms. She was a very pretty little
girl, grandly dressed in a frock of blue silk
embroidered with white daisies, little blue socks
and shoes with diamond buckles. But her face
was sad and pale, and her eyes red from crying,
and her fair hair hung in tangled locks over her
shoulders. She held her dolly clasped tight in
her arms and repeated over and over again: "I
want my mamma, I want to go home to my
mamma."</p>

<p>As the dwarf, followed by Hugo, entered the
room the dwarfs or Kobolds, as they are also
called, bowed down with their heads to the
ground, and sang in a gruff chorus:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"Hail, thrice hail, to King Reinhold,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;We his subjects true and bold</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Bow in homage to our king,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Each his cap on high must fling!"</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>With that each Kobold threw his peaked cap
up to the roof and caught it again on his head,
or his foot, or on his nose as the case might be.
Then they all shouted "Hurrah!" and it was as
if a mighty flock of ravens were to croak all
together. The little girl put her hands up to
her ears, and was about to cry again when she
saw Hugo. Then she jumped up eagerly with
a cry of joy and sprang down the golden steps.</p>

<p>"O you dear, good Hugo," she said, "have
you come to fetch me home? I knew you would
come," she continued, "for I have dreamt of you
so often."</p>

<p>Hugo looked into the sweet little face before
him and, in spite of her fine clothes and diamond
crown, he recognised little Elsa, his lost playmate.
He remembered his dreams, and all seemed
to grow clear. He felt himself very big and
strong and important all at once. Putting his
arms protectingly round the little girl, he said
facing the whole assembly: "I have come to
take this little girl, Miss Elsa, home to her
mamma."</p>

<p>King Reinhold (for it was the king of the
dwarfs himself who had accompanied Hugo)
took up a heavy crown that lay on a cushion
beside him, put it on, and then took it off again,
grumbling that it was too heavy and did not fit
him properly.</p>

<p>Then he cleared his throat and addressed his
courtiers in these words: "Hum! Hum! Hum!
My esteemed subjects! I found this little girl
some weeks ago in the woods, within the magic
circle of my domain. She was crying bitterly,
and seemed very frightened. I comforted her as
best I could. I gave her strings of pretty beads
and a tiny fan of blue jay's feathers. I promised
to take her with me, and give her a crown of
gold, to set her on a golden throne, and make
her Queen of all the dwarfs. I even condescended
to offer her a kiss; but I am sorry to say the
ungrateful child smacked me in the face (cries of
"shame.") There she sits, look at her! how has
she repaid me for all my kindness and for all
the honours I have conferred on her?" (Here
Elsa began to cry again and to clutch tight hold
of Hugo's hand.) "She does nothing but blubber
all day, and cuddle her dolly, and say she wants
to go home to her mamma! I appeal to you, my
Kobolds, is such a baby worthy to be Queen of
our realm, of a people more ancient than the
mountains, older indeed than mankind; for we
were the first inhabitants of the earth, we are
Primitive Man!"</p>

<p>A roar of applause met this speech and cries
of "She is not worthy, let her be deposed,"
were heard. "She is really too young, she is
but a baby still," said one kindly looking old
grandpapa Kobold.</p>

<p>King Reinhold raised his hand to command
silence, and continued in a loud, harsh voice:
"When she is older, she will become too big for
us; mortals have the strange habit of growing.
No, I have thought the matter over. Young
birds are after all safest in the nest. But this
baby would never be able to find the way home,
not even down her own street. So I have chosen
this brave young man to take her home." Here
he gave Hugo a slap on the back that nearly
knocked him down, for dwarfs are very strong in
spite of their smallness, you know.</p>

<p>Elsa's face began to beam, and she would have
danced for joy; but the King's uncomplimentary
remarks hurt her a little. <i>She</i> was quite sure
that she could find her way home, a big girl of
four years ought certainly to know her own
house. She knew exactly where it stood. Near
the rushing silver brook, a low, red-roofed house,
and a barn with black beams, also cocks and hens
and geese strutting about in the little yard. It
was quite near the water-mill; she could hear the
rushing of the water as she lay in her little bed
under her big feather sack, with only her little
nose and ears peeping out. A fir-tree with a
very tall stem and a thick bushy head stood at
the back of the house.</p>

<p>Yes, she was sure that she could find it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some of the dwarfs were marshalled
off to get the carriage ready for the children.
Then Hugo summoned up courage to address the
King.</p>

<p>"O King!" he said, "I have heard of the
wonders of your kingdom and of the marvellous
skill of you workmen"&mdash;here he stammered a
little and his oratory gave way&mdash;"I should so
much like to see something of it," he said shyly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, with the greatest pleasure,"
said King Reinhold, and looked much
gratified. "Intelligent child," he muttered.
"Ho, Dickkopf, bring me a torch, and lead the
way to the workshop," he said.</p>

<p>Off he marched with majestic tread, and Hugo
followed with Elsa, her little warm hand clasped
tight in his own; through dark passages and
caves lit by a pale light; through store-rooms
where masses of minerals were piled up gleaming
in wonderful colours; through the treasure-houses
containing gold and silver and precious
stones in huge quantities.</p>

<p>The children's eyes grew round in their heads
as they saw all this wealth; but they did not
understand much about the value of these
treasures; toys or sweeties would have been more
to their taste.</p>

<p>At last they reached a long, narrow hall where
thousands of little men, with leather aprons on,
sat busy at work. Each was employed in adorning
and completing some work of art: costly
goblets, beautiful chain rings, and necklaces
were there, such as were never seen in the finest
shops of Paris, Berlin or London.</p>

<p>The "joy of the making" was written on
every countenance; for the artist is always happy
when at work.</p>

<p>One dwarf was illuminating a book, and a
beautiful design of grasses and butterflies grew
up under his clever fingers.</p>

<p>"Take the book," said King Reinhold to
Hugo. "It is only a tiny chapter from the
great book of Nature that has neither beginning
nor end. But if you study it carefully and
earnestly, it will always bring you hope and
happiness, whatever your learned men may say
to the contrary. Hold the pages to the light,
and you will see that they are transparent."</p>

<p>As Hugo did so with the deepest interest,
behold! the pictures became alive; the butterflies
changed into fairies and laughed, and nodded at
him in a friendly way.</p>

<p>"Look <i>through</i> the book of Nature till you
find the soul of things," said King Reinhold.</p>

<p>Although this sounded very deep and mysterious,
Hugo seemed to understand. Do you, I
wonder, little children, who read this story? Or
are you like the boy in the kindergarten to whom
I was telling a fairy story and who interrupted
me contemptuously with the remark: "Fairies
don't exist!"</p>

<p>"O don't they my little man!" said I.
"Well <i>you</i> think so."</p>

<p>Presently we read of a ball that grew, and he
spoke again with great energy: "Balls don't
grow."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh!" said I, "Have you ever seen a
little green apple." Then I tried to show him
what wonderful things are always happening in
this world of ours, if only we have eyes to see
them. I do not think I convinced him; for he
was very pig-headed and had a great opinion of
himself; and such people big or little are very
difficult to argue with.</p>

<p>To Elsa, Reinhold gave a handful of exquisite
roses. "In fairyland roses mean love and
happiness," he said. "Little girls should be
happy all the day long, and not wet the world
with their tears. There are tears enough
already"&mdash;he said ponderingly&mdash;"tears in the
centre of the earth."</p>

<p>Opening out of the hall on either side were
huge furnaces. Here the Kobolds were busy
smelting the ore, and preparing the materials
for the more skilled workmen. Here too were
little cupboards with shelves into which the
costly vases were put, in order to be burnt hard
like china.</p>

<p>The heat was so intense that Hugo and Elsa
could only just peep in. It seemed to them as
if the little men must be roasted alive; but the
Kobolds were used to it, and found it quite cool
and pleasant. They swung their hammers and
chattered away at the same time, the busier the
merrier; they were never idle or tired of their
work.</p>

<p>A young dwarf page entered the hall and
announced that the carriage was ready. In
another moment Hugo and Elsa found themselves
standing in the forest in the moonlight. A
carriage stood ready for them drawn by six
stags. King Reinhold had dispensed with the
ceremony of leave-taking; he hated fusses, and
wanted to smoke his pipe in peace.</p>

<p>Hugo recognised the stags; he had fed them in
the winter from the windows of the forestry; they
knew him too, and nodded their gentle heads.</p>

<p>O what a ride that was home through the warm
September night! They saw neither spirit nor
goblin; no fairy marvel was revealed to them;
only the strong, sweet scent of the firs, the dark,
weird shape of the trees, and the stars that shone
through the branches!</p>

<p>They held one another tight by the hand, and
leaned back on the soft cushions; they said
nothing, they felt as if they were in a dream.</p>

<p>Presently they heard the noise of a little
brook that was hidden in the dark trees, and
shortly afterwards they turned a corner and saw
the little village of Elhalten before them, peaceful
and still in the early morning light.</p>

<p>Elsa recognised her home after all, and called
to the stags to stop. Then she kissed Hugo and
laid her little cheek against his and said:
"Good-bye, darling," and then she slipped into
her house, and it all seemed quite natural. You
may imagine <i>how</i> delighted Elsa's mother was
to have her baby girl in her arms again. There
was such a kissing and hugging as never was
before!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hugo drove up the steep side of
the K&uuml;ppel in the rosy light of the early morning;
luckily he met no one on that lonely way.
Once he thought he saw a white form standing
at the end of the path, like a tall woman who
waved her arms and beckoned. But when he
looked more closely, it was but the growing light
of day through the trees, and not Mother Holle,
or the Wood-woman, as he had imagined. The
stags galloped along swiftly in spite of the rough
road, and soon stopped before the door of the
forestry. There everyone seemed still asleep;
not a sound was to be heard. Hugo stroked the
gentle heads of the stags and bade them good-bye,
and they vanished suddenly in the thicket
of the K&uuml;ppel.</p>

<p>With the first rays of the sun Hugo's mother
awoke, and was most astonished to find that she
had slept all night in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"That's what happens, when one's husband is
away," she said stretching herself and shaking
her clothes. "What has become of Hugo?"
she thought suddenly, and felt anxious. She
went quickly upstairs to the bedroom, but there
lay Hugo snugly curled up in bed with rosy
cheeks and tumbled curls, his nose buried deeply
in his pillow.</p>

<p>As she came in, he roused himself and said:
"Mother, I have been to fetch little Elsa. She
is home again"&mdash;then he turned round and fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next day the news reached them that little
Elsa had really been found.</p>

<p>"Why, how curious, my boy dreamt it last
night," said Mrs Forester.</p>

<p>"She was left at her parents' house at about
four in the morning, so I heard," said her
husband, who had just come home.</p>

<p>Elsa's parents always believed that she had
been stolen by the gipsies; it was strange that
they should have sent her back so soon, without
asking for a reward. Moreover the child was
richly dressed; that was also a queer thing; her
clothes were the wonder and admiration of the
whole village. A blue silk frock, and shoes with
shining buckles; never had such a finely dressed
child been seen in Elhalten before.</p>

<p>The simple folk never dreamt that the buckles
were real diamonds and worth a large sum of
money.</p>

<p>When Hugo and Elsa met again on the
following Sunday, you may be sure that they had
much to talk about, at least when they were left
alone undisturbed by grown-ups!</p>

<p>Although the fairy gifts were invisible to all
save the children themselves, it seems that they
had an influence on them as they grew older.</p>

<p>Elsa became a sweet, loving little person, the
sunshine of her home&mdash;so she was called&mdash;and
very, very seldom did anyone see her crying.</p>

<p>Hugo was a quiet, shy boy; but he seemed to
observe everything and people said of him:
"Hugo has his eyes open; he will make his mark
in the world some day." So the children grew up
happy and good, and what can you want to know
more about them than that?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WITCHS_GRANDDAUGHTER" id="THE_WITCHS_GRANDDAUGHTER"></a>THE WITCH'S GRANDDAUGHTER</h2>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>In a green valley between two mountain-slopes
lay a little village crowned by the Castle of
Eppenhain, that stood on the mountain-side,
built on projecting slabs of rock.</p>

<p>The quaint old houses of the village with their
red, slanting roofs, and black-beamed walls, made
a pretty picture in the May sunshine as Count
Karl of Eppenhain rode through the stone-paved
highway, mounted on his white steed decked with
scarlet fringes. The lilac bushes were in flower,
the air was sweet with their scent, the laburnums
hung out their "gold rain" between the houses,
the cherry-trees in the little gardens shed their
blossoms like snow.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the village was a house
somewhat larger than the peasant's cottages, with
many gables and corners. This house was surrounded
on all sides by a thick briar hedge. The
Count knew that it had belonged to an old woman
who was said to be a witch. There she had lived
all alone, save for her seven cats, her seven
ravens, her poultry&mdash;famous for the remarkable
size of the eggs&mdash;and her little granddaughter,
Babette.</p>

<p>Count Karl had heard that the old woman was
dead; for there had been a great fuss about her
burial. The villagers had said that as she was
a notorious witch, she ought not to be buried in
consecrated ground; but as the old lady had left
money to the church, her tombstone was erected
after all in the little churchyard. The village
boys declared that they had seen her riding on a
broomstick over the church spire; but the Count
did not believe such tales. He wondered what
had become of the child; she was the prettiest,
as well as the most mischievous and ill-behaved
child in the village.</p>

<p>As the Count came up to the house, he heard
voices shouting and scolding. Then he saw a
strange hunting scene. The hunters were not
men, but women with sticks and brooms, and the
creature pursued was neither a hare nor a fox,
but just a little girl.</p>

<p>Yes, it was little Babette, the witch's granddaughter.
She was leading the fat peasant
women a fine dance. They were quite unused to
running, and were obliged to stop every few
minutes to pant; then Babette danced just before
them, made naughty faces, and (oh, fie!) stuck
out her little red tongue. Her hair blew over
her head in the fresh breeze, till she looked like
some tall flower with curling petals. Sometimes
she stopped and shook her little fist at her pursuers;
then off she flew again. She knew every
nook and corner of the garden, and that was to
her advantage.</p>

<p>The Count paused, laughed, then blew a blast
from his horn.</p>

<p>Instantly everyone stood still as if they were
living pictures.</p>

<p>"Hi! Ho! Come here, good folk!" he cried.</p>

<p>The women came at once, wiping their hot
faces with the corner of their aprons, puffing and
blowing like so many fat seals. Babette stood
at a safe distance, but near enough to hear all
that went on.</p>

<p>"Please sir," said one of the women with a
curtsy, "as your Lordship knows, the child's
granny is dead and buried. Four days has the
child lived here all alone, never a bite or sup
has she had; she will die of starvation. (Here
Babette laughed.) She hides in the bushes like
the wild cat that she is!"</p>

<p>"Babette, little Babette, come here, child," he
called, interrupting the old woman's narrative.</p>

<p>She came at once in obedience to his gentle
command. She gave him one glance out of her
deep brown eyes, lifting up her long black lashes,
and his heart was captured at once. He was very
fond of children, but he had none of his own.
Here was a beautiful child that seemed ready
made for him. Not one of the women before him
really wished to keep her; for they feared her,
and the supposed power of her dead grandmother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the child stood by the Count, and
began to stroke his fine embroidered sleeve;
finally she slipped her little hand into his. This
settled the matter.</p>

<p>"Well, well, we must see what is to be done
for the child. Meanwhile I shall take her up
with me to the Castle. She seems to have made
you all rather hot," he remarked mischievously
to the reddest and stoutest of the women.</p>

<p>"A devil's brat, I call her!" she muttered in
return, between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Hush," said my Lord indignantly, "she
looks more like a little angel," and, indeed, at
his kind words her small face had become very
sweet.</p>

<p>As he mounted his horse again and lifted
Babette to place her before him, she began to cry
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Why, little one, what ails you?" he said.
"Are you frightened?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o-o-o-o," said Babette, "but I don't
want to go away from my <i>beau-ti</i>-ful home!"</p>

<p>"You shall have a far more beautiful home,
and everything that you can want, shall be
yours," he said. "Why, you would have starved
there alone, you poor little thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said Babette, "for Lucky&mdash;she is
my pet hen you know&mdash;always laid the biggest
eggs for me; then I make a little hole and suck
them so. (She tossed back her curly head.) Then
I am never hungry or thirsty. O, who will feed
Lucky, and all the baby chickens; and my cats?"
she continued, and began to cry again.</p>

<p>"We will fetch them all up to the Castle,"
said his Lordship consolingly.</p>

<p>The road wound upwards and upwards, until
they reached at length the gateway of the Castle.
The heavy gates stood open to receive them. There
was a pretty terraced garden in the front, where
peacocks strutted up and down, who nodded their
heads as if they knew Babette.</p>

<p>A dog sprang out barking to meet his master.
Count Karl patted his head; then he lifted
Babette from his horse, and led her by the hand
into the Castle. "Welcome to Eppenhain, my
little maid," he said, formally, but kindly.</p>

<p>Her little heart beat fast; for she was timid,
like all wild, untamed creatures, and did not
know what might happen to her next. The
Count drew back the heavy curtain that hung
before the entrance to a room; and there in a deep
window niche sat a lady dressed in a rich green
velvet dress with puffed sleeves, and a gold chain
round her neck. She was working at embroidery
on a frame. She sprang up at once, as her husband
(for it was the Countess herself) entered the
room, and uttered a cry of surprise as she saw the
child.</p>

<p>"Why, what dirty little thing have you picked
up? Send her away again at once," she said
imperiously. "Don't touch me, child," as
Babette attempted to stroke her grand dress.</p>

<p>Now the Count had not noticed that Babette
was very dirty, that her red pinafore hung in
rags, and her hair had not been combed for many
a day. He was somewhat taken aback, and saw
that he had been rash.</p>

<p>"She shall be washed and properly dressed,
and <i>then</i> you will see," he said. He dared not
tell her his plans at once. He sent for his old
nurse, who had brought him up as a boy, and
gave the child into her care.</p>

<p>The poor woman soon had her hands full, I
can tell you! You might as well have tried to
dress a hare as Babette! She <i>would</i> not stand
still for a second, and as for a bath, she seemed
to be quite afraid of it. However, several maids
were called, and Babette was bathed in spite of
kicks and screams. She was no sooner in the
water than she began to splash about like a baby,
and to enjoy herself finely. It was almost as
difficult to get her out as to put her in! Some
old clothes that had belonged to the Count's
sister, were produced. Babette thought them very
fine, and seemed quite pleased, she stroked the
old nurse's cheek, chucked her under the chin,
and sprang up and down violently on her knee,
"nearly cracking my old bones," as nurse related
afterwards. Her curls were the most trouble; it
would take more than one day's brushing to set
them in order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Count Karl had been explaining to
his wife that he meant to adopt Babette, and
bring her up as his own daughter.</p>

<p>"A witch's offspring without a family pedigree,"
exclaimed his wife, "must I be mother
to a witch's brat?"</p>

<p>Just then the "witch's brat" entered the
room, making a funny bobbing curtsy, as nurse
had taught her to do, just outside the door. Very
pretty she looked in her low-necked, white-embroidered
frock, with the cherry-coloured sash,
her face flushed after the bath. Even her Ladyship
was bound to acknowledge that she was quite
a lovely child.</p>

<p>"What is your name, child?" she said condescendingly.</p>

<p>"I don't love you," said Babette, and stuck
out her tongue.</p>

<p>"Babette," said the Count sternly, "if you
are a <i>good</i> little girl, and do as you are told, you
may stay here with us, and this lady will be your
mother, and I your father. Then you will be
brought up as a lady instead of becoming a little
heathen and wild girl of the woods."</p>

<p>Babette stood still a moment, as if she were
considering the matter; then she gravely kissed
his Lordship's hand. The Countess extended her
lily-white fingers, and Babette kissed them as
well, but timidly; for she feared a rebuff.</p>

<p>Just at this moment a noise of scratching and
miewing was heard at the window.</p>

<p>Babette flew to open it, and in walked&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;seven cats with their tails in the
air rubbing themselves comfortably against the
window-pane.</p>

<p>"O my dear Fotchen, dear Silverpaws, how
glad I am to see you!" exclaimed Babette, and
she kissed them all.</p>

<p>"<i>What next?</i>" said the poor Countess, holding
up her hands in horror!</p>

<p>In a few minutes there came a rap at the
window, seven times repeated. These were the
ravens. However, they did not venture into the
room; they were afraid of the big gun that stood
in the corner. They flew straight up into a tall
fir-tree, and there they chattered away as usual,
hidden by the dark branches.</p>

<p>The funniest sight of all was the arrival of the
poultry. The cocks walked first with an air of
importance and authority; the baby bantams sat
on their mothers' backs; the whole procession
toiled up the hill to the Castle and entered by the
yard gate. The servants watched them with
astonishment; they too said: "What next?"
However, no one grumbled, not even the Countess
when she heard of it; for such guests were
welcome. The old witch's hens were renowned
for the size of their eggs; they had often been
bought for use at the Castle.</p>

<p>Now the clock struck seven.</p>

<p>"High time for little girls to have their supper
and go to bed," said her Ladyship, and nurse
was called, and carried Babette off again.</p>

<p>A beautiful wooden cot, painted white and
gold, stood in the room where Babette was to
sleep. It was still called the nursery; for the
Count and his sister had slept there as children.</p>

<p>Nurse persuaded her to let five of the cats sleep
outside in the barn; but she begged so hard to
have Fotchen and Silverpaws that nurse sent for
a bundle of hay, and the two pussies slept in a
corner of the room to keep her from feeling
homesick.</p>

<p>Babette stole out of her bed at six o'clock the
next morning. She dressed herself in haste; she
was so anxious to see her new surroundings. It
seemed to her like a wonderful dream, or like
one of the fairy stories that her old grandmother
had so often narrated to her.</p>

<p>Yesterday, little, wild Babette, whom no one
cared for, and everyone scorned; to-day, the
Count's own daughter. She would try and be
<i>so</i> good, never naughty any more. She smoothed
her hair a little with her fingers; washing she
did not think necessary. Then she went down
the big oak staircase followed by her two pussies.
When the young servants saw her, they began to
tease her unmercifully and to pull the cats' tails.</p>

<p>Then Babette grew very angry. "Leave my
cats alone, will you?" she said. She stamped
her little foot, made ugly faces, and used bad
words. Finally she escaped from her persecutors
into the garden. Here she was alone. She sat
down and cried with rage and sorrow. She had
meant to be so good; but it was very hard when
people were so horrid!</p>

<p>However she heard a cock-a-doodle-do from the
hen-house, and ran off there, forgetting her
troubles. She was greeted by a chorus of melodious
voices. They made such a noise that they
woke my Lady out of her comfortable early-morning
doze. Lucky had laid an immense egg.
She rolled it with pride to the feet of her young
mistress, who promptly began to suck its contents.
The ravens flew down to greet her, and she
stroked their glossy plumage.</p>

<p>The five cats were still shut up and miewed
bitterly. Babette luckily met one of the gardeners
who opened the door of the barn and freed the
captives. They followed her into the big kitchen
with the shining copper pans, purring and rubbing
themselves against her legs. Babette coaxed
the cook till he gave her seven saucers of milk;
then there was a great smacking of lips.</p>

<p>When nurse awoke as usual at seven o'clock,
she was frightened to find that her little charge
had vanished. "What a child to look after in
my old age!" she groaned. "And yet she is
taking too! How sweet she looked curled up in
the old cot." She soon found out from the
servants what Babette had been doing; so the
child was seized upon, washed and brushed again,
and dressed in a stiff frock with white frills.</p>

<p>Quite sober and respectable our little wild girl
looked when she went downstairs after breakfast
to see my Lord and Lady in the dining-room.</p>

<p>She sat on the high, straight-backed sofa, and
played with the carved lions' heads, and had
never a word to say for herself until the Count
produced a doll that he had rummaged out from
among some old treasures. It was yellow from
age; but its frock was of satin, and it had on
little gold shoes. To Babette, who had never
had a doll of her own, it seemed very lovely
indeed. "Is it <i>really</i> for me?" she asked in
tones of ecstasy.</p>

<p>She was perfectly good all the morning, playing
with it, washing its face, dressing and undressing
it, and putting it to bed as little girls love
to do.</p>

<p>At dinner she shocked the polite company by
putting her food into her mouth with her fingers;
forks and spoons she did not know how to
manage. So she was sent to have dinner with
the servants who made fine fun of her again,
till she flew into a passion and declared with
many tears that she would run away. Then they
were frightened lest my Lord should hear the
noise, and soothed and petted her till she was
quiet again. They did not mean to be unkind;
they were only stupid, and thought her tempers
amusing.</p>

<p>Well, the days went on, and Babette became
more gentle and docile, and gave up many of her
wild ways. She saw but little of the Countess,
but she grew to admire the grave, silent lady,
and to long for some response to her affection.
My Lord was Babette's best friend and protector
in all her childish troubles. Everyone said that
he was quite infatuated with the child. He
would play ball with her in the garden,
"regardless of his knightly dignity," as his
wife remarked.</p>

<p>Babette knew all the animals about the Castle
and ruled over them like a little queen.</p>

<p>She would go up to the proud peacocks and
say imperiously: "Spread out your tails, or I
will smack your silly heads!" and they obeyed
her meekly at once.</p>

<p>She had a pet frog in the pond, and once when
the gardener was scolding her for breaking some
of his beautiful lilies, she popped it down his
neck, to his horror and disgust! For this she
was whipped and put to bed. I think she richly
deserved it&mdash;don't you?</p>

<p>The garden at the back of the Castle led into
the dense forest by which the mountains were
covered. Babette would sit on the stone wall
and gaze into the deep shades, as if she could
see things there that were invisible to others.
She knew how to call the deer. One day she
enticed a fine stag into the garden. She made
a garland of cornflowers and ox-eye daisies, and
threw it over his antlers; then she sprang on his
back, holding a red foxglove in her hand for a
whip, and galloped round the garden, singing
and shouting: "Look at me, look at me! I am
the Queen of the fairies!"</p>

<p>The Countess herself owned that she had never
seen a prettier sight; but then she sighed deeply,
and said to her husband she feared all was not
right with the child.</p>

<p>The Count shared her fears to some extent, and
nurse had orders never to let her out of her sight.</p>

<p>Nurse had several times seen a strange man
watching Babette from over the wall as she
played alone in the garden. She too felt nervous
and anxious about her little charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>Years passed by, Babette grew into a tall and
charming maiden. She learned to read and
write, and to play on the harp. She could even
speak a little French, which was the fashionable
language of the Court in those days. So that
with these accomplishments she was considered
a fine lady, far above the village children, who
had formerly despised her.</p>

<p>One fine evening (she was then about sixteen
years of age) she was walking with her old nurse
in the forest, not far from the Castle, picking bilberries,
and singing to herself songs of her own
composing. The wood was very still; not a leaf
stirred. The setting sun shone out behind a
beech-tree, making a brilliant star of iridescent
colours that dazzled her eyes. She heard a
sudden noise as of a cough: the bushes near her
rustled. She felt frightened and called out:
"Nurse, nurse," in trembling tones.</p>

<p>As she spoke, a man sprang out of the wood
and seized her by the arm. Nurse began to
scream; but the man raised the stick he had in
his hand, and she stood as if turned to stone.</p>

<p>Babette's courage always rose to emergencies.
She looked the man over from head to foot. He
was dressed in green, with a red feather in his
cap. His hair was dark and curly; his eyes were
large and would have been beautiful, but that
they had a wild and sinister look that Babette
did not like, and squinted slightly. She seemed
to remember his face; but where or when she had
seen him before, she did not know. Her first
thought was that he must be a wizard like one
of those her grandmother had told her stories
about.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he said, shaking her slightly.</p>

<p>"I am Babette, daughter of Count Karl of
Eppenhain," said Babette proudly.</p>

<p>"A Count's daughter&mdash;a fine tale&mdash;the witch's
granddaughter you mean," he said with emphasis,
and Babette shuddered. "Come along with me,
child!" he continued, "you must follow me
now, and serve me well and cook my dinners. I
knew your old grandmother and have often seen
you as a child; a little imp you were," he said.
"Now it is high time you learnt to be useful;
they will only turn your head, and teach you
rubbish up there at the Castle; you must come
along with me now." Then he turned to the
poor nurse, and said, "In half an hour you will
be free to return to the Castle. Adieu!" He
fixed his strange eyes on the nurse, who swooned
away, and thus she was found exactly half an
hour afterwards by the housemaid, who had
followed her to say that supper was ready.</p>

<p>You may imagine the consternation at the
Castle. The poor Countess who had been so cold
to Babette, seemed to feel it most. She sat and
cried: "O Babette, come back, come back, my
dear, and I will be a real mother to you, indeed
I will."</p>

<p>The Count immediately took steps to recover
her. The forests were searched through and
through by his men; but not the slightest trace
could they discover.</p>

<p>The seven ravens said: "Caw, caw," and set
off at once in search of her.</p>

<p>The next day Fotchen and Silverpaws and the
other cats disappeared. Lucky and several of
the old witch's hens were also missed.</p>

<p>It was evident that they had all followed
Babette, and that she must be alive somewhere;
but where, that was the question. Where there
is magic at work, it is always a difficult matter.</p>

<p>One clever youth remarked that if one could
find her pets, why, then one might find Babette.</p>

<p>But this brilliant idea was not of much use,
as they were <i>all</i> lost.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Babette followed her strange guide
with many misgivings and sad sinkings of the
heart. They had not gone far when they came
to a cottage in the forest, surrounded, like her
granny's garden, by a briar hedge.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you that Babette had fallen
into the power of a reputed wizard, and he had
the power of making everything within this briar
hedge invisible and intangible to those outside.
So that poor Babette would be more safely
imprisoned there than in an iron-barred fortress.
She did not realise this at first; she grew to
understand it later, when she became more
acquainted with the wizard (or Mr Squint-eyes,
as Babette called him) and his ways. The hedge
was so thick and high, and the thorns were so
huge, that it would have been impossible for
Babette to think of squeezing herself through it,
and running away.</p>

<p>The wizard parted this hedge with his wand;
it closed up thick and close behind them as they
entered.</p>

<p>The cottage garden was laid out in patches of
vegetables. Not a flower was to be seen in it;
but there were fruit-trees with ripe apples, and
pears, plums and medlars; for it was the early
autumn. They entered into the little parlour
which seemed dark and gloomy to Babette. Mr
Squint-eyes tossed off a mug of beer that stood
on the table, and told her to be off to bed. The
poor girl was hungry; for bilberries are not very
satisfying and it was supper time; but she crept
up the narrow stairs, too much frightened to say
a word. She found a tiny room with a white bed
in it, a looking-glass, very dim and old and
uncanny-looking, with candlesticks on either side,
also a primitive washing-stand.</p>

<p>As she began to undress, a sense of fear and
loneliness came over her. She thought of her
happy home at Eppenhain, and of the Count,
and hot tears began to fall. However, she was
accustomed to look at the cheerful side of things.
"They are sure to find me to-morrow," she said
to herself; she knew she could not be far away.</p>

<p>The next morning she was awakened by a loud
knocking at the door. The horrid man who had
stolen her, poked his head in, "Get up, get up,
you lazy bones," he said, "and see about my
breakfast."</p>

<p>Babette hurried downstairs and found a small
kitchen, with a door leading into the garden.
There was a heap of dried wood just outside the
door, and, after many attempts, she succeeded in
making the fire.</p>

<p>She filled the heavy iron kettle from the pump
in the yard, making her pretty frock quite black.</p>

<p>"That's right, that's the way that women
should work," said the wizard coolly.</p>

<p>Babette felt indignant and thought that he
might offer to help her, but not a bit of it. There
he stood, leaning against the door, smoking his
long pipe, the picture of laziness.</p>

<p>"Please where is the coffee?" said Babette.</p>

<p>"Use your eyes and you will find it," said
her polite host.</p>

<p>Then she saw a jar on a shelf labelled "Coffee,"
and near it the coffee-mill.</p>

<p>Babette ground the beans till she was red in
the face. Then she waited for the water to boil.
Whilst she was attending to the coffee, rolls and
butter appeared on the table and a blue and white
china coffee service. The table seemed to have
laid itself; for Babette was sure that the man had
never moved from the door. Now breakfast was
ready. They sat down together, the wizard
saying never a word, but lifting one eyebrow at
times in a peculiar way that made Babette feel
very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>After breakfast he went out of the house
saying: "Clean the house, make the beds, cook
the dinner."</p>

<p>"But there is no dinner to cook," said poor
Babette.</p>

<p>"Find it," was all the reply she could get out
of him.</p>

<p>Now Babette had not been remarkable for
obedience and docility, and if anyone had spoken
to her like that at home, she would have rebelled
at once; but she felt instinctively that her safety
here lay in doing exactly as she was told. The
man was half-mad she feared, and if she aroused
his wrath, he might do her bodily harm.</p>

<p>The tears came into her eyes; she felt quite in
despair; but she was a brave girl and determined
to make the best of things.</p>

<p>The vegetables in the garden occurred to her.
She would cook some carrots; that was easy.
Stewed plums would do for pudding; but what
about the soup and the joint?</p>

<p>At this point of her deliberations a hare was
thrown over the hedge. This settled the question.
Evidently the man did not wish to starve.</p>

<p>"But how shall I get its fur off?" thought
Babette. "Bah! I shall never be able to skin
the creature!"</p>

<p>Just then she heard to her joy a "caw caw,"
seven times repeated, and there she saw her dear
ravens sitting on a tree just outside the garden.</p>

<p>Now the limit of invisibility did not exist for
the witch's favourites. They flew at once to
Babette; she told them her troubles, and showed
them the hare.</p>

<p>"That is an easy matter," said the ravens,
"the hare has seven skins; we are seven ravens,
each of us will take off one skin, and may
we have the pickings?" said the greedy
fellows.</p>

<p>"Anything, anything you like! Please take
it away and bring it back again all ready to pop
in the pot!" said Babette.</p>

<p>"Potted or jugged hare famous!" said the
ravens, and they laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, be quiet, or the wizard will catch
you!" she said in a warning tone.</p>

<p>Now the dinner was all ready on the stove.
Potatoes she had dug out of the garden. "Hare
and carrots and stewed plums, what can anyone
want more?" she thought, and felt very proud.
But suddenly soup occurred to her. How could
she make soup? She had heard that soup was
made of bones and water; but she had no bones,
and those nice little halfpenny packets for making
soup out of nothing were not invented in those
days.</p>

<p>She put on some hot water with a few carrots
and a little chopped parsley in it and plenty of
pepper and salt. She tasted it, as a good cook
should, and said to herself: "Not bad, I have
tasted worse."</p>

<p>She laid the table, and punctually at one
o'clock the man came in. Babette trembled. He
proceeded at once to business; that is, he sat down
to dinner.</p>

<p>Soup came first, which was unfortunate.
"Bah!" he said, making a horribly wry face,
"what stuff, child, do you want to make me
sick?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o," said poor Babette.</p>

<p>"Never make such soup again, or I shall fetch
my sister, and she will cook <i>you</i>," he said with
a terrible look.</p>

<p>However the hare was tender, and when a pot
of red-currant jelly produced itself, seemingly
from nowhere, it was quite a fine dinner.</p>

<p>The carrots were hard, and "not scraped," as
the wizard said severely. "Plums too much
sugar."</p>

<p>But in spite of all this grumbling she felt
immensely proud of her morning's work. The
house was not cleaned; neither were the beds
made; but this he did not seem to notice. He
lay on the sofa by the window, covered himself
up with a bear skin, and snored loudly with his
mouth open.</p>

<p>Babette made up the fire, and put the kettle
on to boil for tea. Then she strolled out into the
garden. She climbed up into a pear-tree. From
her perch in its branches she could see far into
the woods. She wondered when her friends
would come and rescue her.</p>

<p>Then she saw to her delight Lucky and some
of her favourite cocks and hens wandering about
in search of her. They came scuttling up at
once. She held up one finger to enjoin silence.
She feared that her capturer might take a fancy
for roast fowl if he should see them. So they
hid under the hedge.</p>

<p>"Now I can make scrambled eggs for supper,"
thought Babette joyfully.</p>

<p>Fotchen and Silverpaws had likewise no rest
when their mistress was gone, and they too set
out in search of her. When they reached the
briar hedge, Babette was indoors making tea.
They began to miew and made a great noise.</p>

<p>"The old woman's cats, by Thor!" said the
wizard. "They know a thing or two. I'll go
and let them in." So saying he again parted
the hedge with his wand, and let them through.
Although Babette was very pleased to see them,
she felt a little anxious as to their welfare.</p>

<p>However the wizard scratched their heads, and
was quite affectionate to them. He had, it
seemed, a partiality for cats.</p>

<p>Babette felt a little happier now that her
pets were with her; yet her heart was sore. She
thought of her lovely house, of her kind, good
foster-father, and of all her friends, and the tears
stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed away, and Babette cooked
and scrubbed every day in fear and trembling,
like a regular little Cinderella. Being German,
she was used to helping in the household, and
was not so inexperienced as many English girls
would have been. But never a word of praise
did she get from her queer companion; but if
anything were amiss, then he opened his mouth
and scolded the poor girl roughly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PART III</h3>

<p>A young man was returning home after a day's
hunting. He was the son of the knight of a
neighbouring castle, and his name was Sir
Rudolf of Ruppertshain. It was a hot afternoon;
the sunlight made a chequered pattern through
the forest trees. His bag was heavy with game,
and he whistled merrily as he strode between the
oak-trees and bracken fern. He had a light heart
and an easy conscience, few enemies and many
friends, and added to these advantages was
the exhilarating feeling of youth and perfect
health.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and looked around him,
startled. He heard a sweet voice singing. The
notes were clear and distinct as those of a bird,
and yet it was no bird. Who could it be in this
lonely spot? He could distinguish the words of
the song as he held his breath to listen:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left">"A lonely maiden, I,</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Rudolf's eyes were trained by hunting. He
searched the woods carefully round that place,
and peered behind every bush and tree; but
nothing was to be seen. His heart beat fast, this
was a real adventure. Surely if a wood-nymph
or fairy were to appear to him here in this lonely
forest, it would hardly seem strange.</p>

<p>So he summoned up his courage and addressed
the wood-spirit as he thought. "Who are you?
Where are you?" he said. "Be you wood-sprite
or fairy, I fear you not. I am ready to do your
bidding; for your sweet voice and your distress
have touched my heart: appear, O appear!"</p>

<p>Babette (for of course it was she) trembled
with excitement. This was really a chance of
escape. She had seen the young huntsman from
her perch in the pear-tree, and had made up the
impromptu song. She thought it was even more
original than her cooking. Now she answered
eagerly:</p>

<p>"Alas it is impossible for me to appear unto
you; for I am as invisible as if I had on Siegfried's
cap of darkness. I was stolen by a horrid
wizard when I was walking in the forest with
my nurse. Surely you have heard of me?"</p>

<p>Now of course Sir Rudolf had heard of Babette,&mdash;the
story of whose kidnapping was told all over
the country, and became more wonderful with
every telling. Some people said that the devil
himself had carried her off; this was really
unkind; for Babette, though lively, was not a
bad girl, as we know.</p>

<p>"Are you Babette, the witch's granddaughter?"
said the young man hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"O don't, don't say that, I want to forget
that!" said Babette, and he heard a slight sob.
"I am the adopted daughter of Count Karl of
Eppenhain, and O, a wicked wizard holds me
here invisible under a powerful spell. Just
think," said Babette crying again, "I slave for
him all day and cook and do all the house-work,
and never a kind word or look do I get from him
in return. It is a shame. O dear! O dear!"</p>

<p>"Please don't cry, I really cannot bear it,
when I cannot even see you to comfort you,"
said Rudolf tenderly. "Tell me what to do!
Shall I shoot the wizard?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not; besides, he is invisible,
too. You might walk through us all, and notice
no difference, so subtle is the spell," said
Babette.</p>

<p>Rudolf was one of those specially gifted
mortals in whom the sense of things unseen is
as clearly developed as the senses of sight and
hearing. He never doubted Babette's reality,
though I think a more up-to-date youth would
certainly have done so, and have thought that
his imagination was playing tricks with him. He
felt much distressed and perplexed, but could
think of no way out of this strange dilemma.</p>

<p>But an inspiration came to Babette.</p>

<p>"Go to Mother Holle," she said, "if you really
wish to help me. She was an intimate friend of
my grandmother's, and she is a powerful fairy and
can perhaps help us. What is your name, brave
youth?" she continued. "Sir Rudolf of Ruppertshain,"
he answered. "Why, then, I know
your mother quite well; but you were away
travelling with your father, when I visited your
castle. But quick, we must not delay matters
by conversation, though it is <i>dreadfully</i> nice to
talk to a real human being again." Her voice
sounded near and yet far away; "a curious
kind of conversation," Rudolf thought it was.</p>

<p>"Where can I find Mother Holle?" said
Rudolf. "And will she not drop pitch on my
head? I should be no good at shaking feather
beds, you see!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, she won't expect you to do anything
of the sort. She is very kind and friendly;
she lives on the Rossert Mountain, quite near
to your Castle. Hush, hush, go now! my tyrant
is waking up; if he were to suspect us! Go!&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>A complete and somewhat unnatural silence
followed, like one of those awkward pauses in
the conversation when we entertain stiff callers
for the first time.</p>

<p>Then Rudolf took the precaution of marking
the position of the trees in that part of the woods.</p>

<p>Three tall fir-trees raised their heads among
the beech and oaks. He cut a cross <a href="images/img054.jpg">
<img src="images/img054.jpg" height="12" alt="swastika" /></a> thus, on
each one of them, because trees are so deceptive.
This mark is the old symbol of the Mithras cult,
two axes placed sideways signifying the striking
of fire. It is an old sign known and respected
by the fairies; so he hoped that the good folk
would see it and further his quest.</p>

<p>On one of the firs the ravens were assembled.
They caw-cawed seven times to indicate their
willingness to lend Rudolf their aid.</p>

<p>The wizard looked at Babette closely that
evening. The new-born hope, perhaps, too, the
sight of the handsome stranger had given an
extra colour to her cheeks. "I may have trouble
with her yet!" he said to himself, and cleared
his throat with a rumbling sound.</p>

<p>I must tell you that the cocks and hens had
betrayed themselves. They were silent all
through the night, but when the dawn broke,
they could not resist one cock-a-doodle-doo! Then
the wizard chuckled and brought them in; but
nothing had happened to them as yet.</p>

<p>Babette lived during the next days in a state
of suppressed excitement. She felt that something
<i>must</i> happen for good or evil; but she did
not know what. Patient waiting! a hard lesson
for all of us to learn, but harder still for a maiden
of seventeen years who had been kept so long
in that dull hole. She had passed her birthday
in that horrid place! just think of it, and not
one birthday present did she get. She made up
for it afterwards by having two birthdays at once;
but it was not <i>quite</i> so nice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Rudolf had turned homewards
pondering on his strange adventure, and fully
determined to seek Mother Holle's aid. Should
he go first to the Castle of Eppenhain and tell
Babette's foster-parents that he had found out
where Babette was imprisoned? He felt that,
credulous though they were in those days, they
would only laugh at him, and consider the story
as outside the range of possibility. They might
even suggest that a cask of Rhine wine had
clouded his intelligence; no, he would go home
to Ruppertshain Castle and have supper, and
think it over. So he returned home, and was so
silent and dreamy, and his appetite, which was
usually of heroic proportions, was so small that
his mother felt quite anxious about him.</p>

<p>"You are not bewitched, Rudie dear?" she
asked anxiously, just as we might inquire if he
were a little upset.</p>

<p>"I am not sure, mother, maybe I am!" he
answered to the good lady's dismay.</p>

<p>After sprinkling him with various herbs, she
insisted on his drinking some nasty aromatic tea
when he went to bed. As she had put some
spider's legs in it and a few choice things of that
sort, Rudolf asked to be allowed to take it upstairs
with him. Then I regret to say he deceived the
good lady by pouring it out of the window. I
rather think that you or I might have done the
same thing under the circumstances, though it
was undoubtedly wrong.</p>

<p>The full moon was shining into the little
window in the gable of the turret. He shook off
the very natural sleepiness and fatigue consequent
on his night's hunting, took off his soiled
clothes, and dressed himself in his fine velvet
Court suit with the beautiful lace on the collar.</p>

<p>He opened the little window, squeezed himself
(it was lucky that he was slight for a German
knight) through the iron bars, and climbed on
to the roof with some difficulty, not to say
danger. Then he crawled noiselessly along the
Castle walls, fearing to be challenged by the
warder of the Castle on his nightly rounds. But
the warder was just enjoying his seventh glass
of lager beer, and was not very keen on the
look-out.</p>

<p>As he dropped outside the walls, his favourite
dog began to bark and beg to go with him; but
Rudolf did not dare to let him out for fear of
creating a disturbance.</p>

<p>He soon gained the little path which led
through Eppenhain, and then through fields to
the woods that clothed the Rossert. Great clouds
had obscured the moon; but he was not afraid;
he was so used to the woods and could distinguish
one creature from another simply by its
movements.</p>

<p>In his hand he carried a dark lantern. A rough
path covered with rocks and stones led to the
summit of the mountain. As he walked cautiously
along, a bat hit him in the face as it blundered
along. "Hi, ho, steady there, old fellow!"
said Rudolf. He now entered the part of the
woods where the beeches and oaks grow so closely
together that at midday the sky seems green,
rather than blue. The moon shone out suddenly,
and he saw by its light a gruesome-looking head
without a body that seemed to grin at him from
among the undergrowth. His heart stood still
for a moment, and then he laughed at his
fears; for he saw that it was only a grotesque
old tree-stump, such as one so often sees in the
woods.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a bright light through the
trees, as if one of the bushes were on fire, or was
it merely the brilliant moonbeams shining on a
wet clearing?</p>

<p>For a moment all was still; then lightning
played across his path, revealing a huge clumsy-looking
giant who stood with club uplifted in the
way, looking as if he would dash his brains out.
Brave though Rudolf was, he did not wish to
court danger; so he turned aside into the woods
hoping to find another path before long that was
not thus barricaded. Then voices seemed to
mock him and to laugh at him, and he had the
unpleasant sensation of dark shadows, moving as
he moved, shadows unaccompanied by substance.</p>

<p>The rain came down, pouring, drenching rain,
such as the forests love. In a few minutes he
was wet to the skin, as wet as if he had plunged
into the river with his clothes on. Naturally
his vanity was to blame for this; in his stout
hunting clothes and thick leather boots even a
deluge could not have wetted him through. To
add to this, the air was close and stifling, and he
had lost his way. All this for the sake of an
unseen maiden. What if she were as old and
ugly as Fr&auml;ulein Kunigunde of whom Heinrich
von Kleist has written? Somehow he felt that
was impossible; but even if it had been so, his
natural gallantry would not have deserted him,
and we will hope that he would still have sought
to deliver her.</p>

<p>A Christian knight is ready to help all women,
be they young or old, rich or poor, plain or
pretty.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased; but there was a sense of
something oppressive in the atmosphere. An owl
with eyes that looked like live coals glared at
him from the branch of an oak-tree, vanishing
as he approached. A fox? No, it was too large
for a fox; it was a wolf (there were really wolves
in the Taunus woods in those days!) came up to
him snarling. Rudolf had his gun ready, but
the creature moved away into the darkest shades,
snarling and growling as it went.</p>

<p>Altogether I cannot say it was a pleasant walk.
I do not think any one of us would have enjoyed
it all alone at the dead of night, do you?</p>

<p>At this moment came a flash of lightning that
struck down a tree just before Rudolf's eyes.
He crossed himself involuntarily and muttered a
paternoster.</p>

<p>A lull followed the storm; the heavens were
clear again. Rudolf made out by the light of
his lantern a triangular spot made by three footpaths
crossing. It was bare of all vegetation;
black ashes were heaped up in the middle as if
gipsies had lately lit a fire there.</p>

<p>An irresistible impulse made him enter this
triangle, though he felt as if long ghostly arms
were trying to hold him back.</p>

<p>No sooner had he stepped on to this spot than
he fell into a deep sleep or faint. When he
awoke, he saw a wonderful light near him, and
in the midst of the light which seemed to radiate
from her presence, was a beautiful lady, with
long rippling fair hair.</p>

<p>"You are safe now in my kingdom," she said.
"You have passed the boundary between the
good and evil powers, and have left the dangers
of the night behind you."</p>

<p>"O can you tell me where to find Mother
Holle, beautiful fairy?" he said.</p>

<p>"Easily enough, for I <i>am</i> Mother Holle!"
she answered. "I know why you have come
here, and I am ready to help you." She took
him by the hand, and he leapt to his feet,
making a low bow to the lovely lady. All the
evil dreams that had perplexed him, fled as the
night before the day, and he could have shouted
hurrah! for joy and gladness.</p>

<p>He had the unshaken confidence in the final
victory of good over evil, that is so necessary to
help us to any measure of success in this world
with its chequered lights.</p>

<p>He walked with Mother Holle a little way, till
they came to an arbour made of honeysuckle and
wild roses, surrounded by banks of evening
primroses, round which luminous moths were
fluttering. Into this they entered, and she sat
down and gazed at him, till he was quite overwhelmed
with her beauty. He had expected to
see an old witch hobbling along with a stick and
to have feather beds to make! Feather pillows,
indeed, there were in the arbour, very cosy and
soft. It was delightful to have a chat with such
a woman in such a place, even if there were no
Babette in the world.</p>

<p>Mother Holle began to speak, her voice
sounded like the murmur of the fir-trees.</p>

<p>"I have heard that pretty little Babette has
fallen into the power of a bad man. He stole
the magic book from her grandmother's house at
a time when the old lady was ill and feeble,
shortly before her death. He has been only able
to make out a few of the spells&mdash;that, for instance,
for rendering things invisible. He is not a real
wizard, so that if you obtain the book, the power
will be yours. But I strongly advise you to have
nothing to do with magic; it is very dangerous;
but to return the book to me, to whom, in fact,
it rightfully belongs."</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that," laughed Rudolf. "I
don't want it, I would not touch it with the tongs
if I could help it."</p>

<p>"Now listen carefully to my instructions! At
the foot of one of the fir-trees, grows a red toadstool,
spotted with white. On it sits an ugly
old toad. Take this handkerchief (she gave him
a lovely gauze scarf), wrap the toad in it, and
cast it to the ground. Pull up the toadstool.
Then the whole place will become visible, and
you will be able to consult with Babette as to
how to overcome old Squint-eyes, as she calls
him.</p>

<p>"Hold this candle alight in your hand"&mdash;she
gave him the young pointed top of a fir-tree&mdash;"it
will keep off evil spells. When you have
overcome the man, bind him with this grass."
So saying, she gave him a bundle of silvery
woodland grass. "Then tie him up to the tallest
of the three fir-trees and leave him to us. We
will punish him according to his deserts, and
teach him to behave better in the future."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything about the fair
young lady herself? Is she really the granddaughter
of a witch? I could well believe it;
for verily she has bewitched me; but who were
her parents? I wish to know for her own sake,"
asked Rudolf anxiously.</p>

<p>"The old woman was really her nurse," said
Mother Holle. "It is true that the woman had
fairy blood in her veins and was learned in magic,
but she never used her powers for any evil purposes,
and as for riding on a broomstick, she
abhorred such practices. Babette is the granddaughter
of the great Baron of Siebenbergen.
The Baron brought his children up strictly as
became their rank; but his youngest son ran away
from home, and married a village maiden much
beneath him in rank.</p>

<p>"His father was exceedingly angry and
refused to acknowledge her. The young wife
died when Babette was born. The father went
off in despair to the wars. He entrusted the tiny
baby to the care of an old woman who had
formerly been his own nurse. This old woman,
who was spoken of later as Babette's grandmother,
had been nurse to the children in Siebenbergen
Castle for many years; but she had been
dismissed suddenly in her old age, because evil
tongues had denounced her as a witch. The
Baron did not believe in the charge, but, nevertheless,
he was obliged to send her away. He
had his own reputation in the country to think
of, and the charge of witchcraft was no light
one in those days, and not so easy to disprove.
He gave her a handsome pension, and a comfortable
house and troubled himself no more about
her.</p>

<p>"Babette's father lost interest in life on the
death of his dearly beloved peasant wife. He
fought recklessly in the front of the battle, and
fell, covered with many wounds. His body was
brought home for burial and there was a grand
funeral in Siebenbergen. Everyone praised his
heroism, and lamented his early death, but no
one inquired after his peasant wife, or knew of
the existence of his baby daughter.</p>

<p>"The notice of the marriage and the certificate
of Babette's birth are to be found in the church
of Eppenhain, all duly registered and complete.</p>

<p>"The old nurse became very feeble and was
hardly fitted to bring up such a wild, high-spirited
child as Babette. That is all I can tell
you; you must find the papers, and test the
accuracy of the story for yourself."</p>

<p>Rudolf was deeply interested; his heart beat
fast. Babette became more and more interesting,
wrapped round in a web of romance. He wanted
to ask more questions of Mother Holle; but she
faded slowly away. As she vanished, a voice
said: "Adieu, follow the light path, and nothing
can molest you."</p>

<p>A long stream of light shone out from where
she had stood and illumined the way through the
woods. It shone on and on in one great bright
path, like the moon shining over the sea.
Rudolf reached home walking like one in a
dream, his head full of strange and marvellous
fancies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PART IV</h3>

<p>Rudolf awoke rather later than usual; for he
was thoroughly tired out. His mother did not
feel so concerned about him when she saw the
amount of breakfast he consumed; but he was
still silent and abstracted. His adventures
seemed to him like a wild dream. It seemed
almost absurd to seek for the three firs; but yet
an irresistible longing led him thither.</p>

<p>On the stroke of twelve at midday he stood
beneath them, and recognised his own sign, and
O joy! saw the toadstool with the toad sitting on it.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation he took the
handkerchief ("which was in itself a proof of
the reality of the story," he said to himself) and
seized the horrid shiny toad (how it wriggled
and squirmed like some evil thing!) and cast it
to the ground where it sprang into a thousand
pieces. These pieces took root in the earth, so
to speak, and came up again as a multitude of
toadstools quite wonderful to behold. Perhaps
you may see them if you ever come across this
spot in your excursions to the Taunus Mountains.</p>

<p>Then Rudolf took hold of the red and white
toadstool on which the toad had sat. Surely
never before had a fungus been so firmly planted
in the earth! The whole ground seemed to
shake and tremble as he tugged at it; trees were
uprooted in the forest; the earth moved up and
down like the waves of the sea. At last it was
out, and bump down fell Rudolf. One of the
great fir-trees fell as well, luckily in another
direction, or he might have been crushed beneath
it.</p>

<p>When he got up again, he saw to his joy a little
red-roofed house and a pretty maiden sitting in
a pear-tree.</p>

<p>Babette had been watching him all the time;
but she could not make out what he was doing.
She had nearly fallen off the tree as he pulled up
the toadstool. Now she climbed carefully down
and came to the hedge and their eyes met. Need
I say that they fell in love, or, at any rate,
Rudolf did, at first sight. The hedge parted to
let him through. Perhaps this was caused by
the fairy candle, or perhaps it was Mother Holle's
doing&mdash;who knows?</p>

<p>"Hush, he is asleep, you have come just at
the right moment," said Babette.</p>

<p>"We must secure the magic book first of all,"
said Rudolf, holding the fir-branch firmly in his
hand, "and would you kindly light this candle
for me?"</p>

<p>Babette laughed. "A funny candle," she
said.</p>

<p>"A <i>fairy</i> candle," he whispered, "to keep off
evil spells. Mother Holle recommended it."</p>

<p>Babette felt inclined to dance for joy. "Can
you really <i>see</i> me?" she whispered. "O how
untidy and ragged I am, you must think me a
perfect fright!"</p>

<p>"I think you are the most beautiful lady I
have ever seen," said Rudolf sincerely, and
Babette blushed at the compliment, and felt very
grown-up and important.</p>

<p>"I will light the candle for you at the kitchen
fire. Come, we will go together softly and try
and get the magic book. I know where it is. It
is under the sofa where Old Squint-eyes is asleep.
Follow me. Throw all that grass away," she
said in her old imperious way.</p>

<p>"Let me give it to you to hold," said Rudolf.
"It is also a gift from Mother Holle, and may
come in useful."</p>

<p>They walked together towards the house,
Babette holding the bunch of silvery grass, and
entered the kitchen. Here Babette lit the fir-branch.</p>

<p>"It smells just like Christmas; there must be
good times coming for poor little me," she said.</p>

<p>Then they peeped into the parlour, and there
was Mr Wizard fast asleep in spite of the earthquake.
Rudolf could hardly help laughing; he
looked such a funny sight with his mouth wide
open, his nose very red, and his hair hanging
over his face.</p>

<p>Babette lifted up the bear-skin rug and pulled
out the heavy book; but, as soon as she touched
the book, the wizard awoke and seized her by the
arm and sprang to his feet with many curses.</p>

<p>When he saw Rudolf, he let go of Babette's
arm and tried to seize the young man. Rudolf
was fully prepared and threw him off with all his
force. A wrestling match began, and it might
have ended badly for Rudolf; for his adversary
was tremendously strong and agile, but that he
had unexpected assistance. The ravens flew in
at the window, and beat themselves against
Rudolf's opponent, nearly blinding him. The
cats stood on the cupboard, with their backs up
and hair bristling ready to spring if necessary.
The cocks and hens crowded on the window-sill
in war-like attitudes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fumes of the fir-candle which
Babette had lit, filled the room, and Mr Squint-eyes
could not abide the smell of burning fir. He
grew weaker and weaker, and more and more
confused, and at last Rudolf threw him down with
such force that he was partially stunned.</p>

<p>Rudolf then took the woodland grass from
Babette, and as he touched it, it wound itself in
his hands into strong cord. He bound the man
up with Babette's assistance, and gagged him
with Mother Holle's handkerchief.</p>

<p>The two of them then lugged him into the
wood, and tied him up to the biggest of the fir-trees
as Mother Holle had directed. Then they
fetched the magic book and placed it under the
uprooted fir-tree, which instantly stood up again
as if nothing had happened, burying the book
beneath its roots.</p>

<p>They looked at the man they had tied up,
bound like a martyr to the tree. He could not
curse and swear as his mouth was stopped up;
but he rolled his eyes and squinted so violently
that he was horrible to look at.</p>

<p>Then Rudolf and Babette ran off together.
Breathlessly they ran and ran. Babette was
afraid Old Squint-eyes might wriggle out after
all; he was so thin and wiry, and she had no
fancy for serving him any more. Not until they
came to a main road through the woods leading
to Eppenhain Castle, did they pause to look at
one another.</p>

<p>Then impetuous Babette (she was half a child
still, you must remember) flew at Sir Rudolf and
gave him a kiss. She turned red and white when
she realised, what she had done. "I couldn't
help it," she said. "You are such a <i>dear</i>. I
am so very, very grateful to you for all you have
done for me, an unknown and even unseen
maiden."</p>

<p>"Please, don't apologise, dearest lady," he
said. "I liked it very, very much. Won't you
give me another?"</p>

<p>"<i>Never</i>," said Babette firmly. Subsequent
events however caused her to revoke this determination.</p>

<p>Rudolf did not answer, but offered her his arm,
which she took shyly, glancing at him from time
to time out of her deer-like eyes with the long-fringed
lashes. Ragged and untidy as she was,
she looked like a princess; and he in his fine
clothes, soiled and torn as they were, looked
nevertheless like a real fairy-tale prince!</p>

<p>He took her straight home to Eppenhain
Castle, and you may imagine the excitement
there! The Count clasped Babette in his arms
and could hardly speak for emotion. Then he
turned to Rudolf saying: "We shall never be
able to reward you enough."</p>

<p>"I shall only want one reward, and that is the
little maiden herself," said Rudolf.</p>

<p>The Countess wept and cried over her darling
child, and said she would never scold her any
more.</p>

<p>Nurse said: "Well, Miss Babette, you do look
a fine sight to be sure&mdash;and to come home with
such a pretty young man, too! Come upstairs
with me, and let me make you clean and tidy."
And this Babette was only too glad to do.</p>

<p>A great company of retainers were sent out by
the Count to capture the so-called wizard; but
they were unable to find either the fir-trees with
the mark on them or the man, or the wood cottage.
Neither Babette nor Rudolf set eyes on them since
that day. I cannot say that they were altogether
sorry.</p>

<p>The papers proving Babette's parentage were
found to be in order, and her father's name and
fortune became hers, so that she was not poor,
despised Babette any more&mdash;the witch's granddaughter&mdash;but
a maiden of good rank and birth
with pin-money of her own.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards there was a grand
wedding in Eppenhain, and two happier mortals
never lived than Rudolf and Babette on that day,
and, let us hope, for ever afterwards!</p>

<h2><a name="HOLIDAY_ADVENTURES" id="HOLIDAY_ADVENTURES"></a>HOLIDAY ADVENTURES</h2>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>O it was so hot, so hot; the earth was well-nigh
parched up, and moreover the use of water was
restricted in the town where the children lived.
The flowers in the little garden were drooping
for want of moisture, and the trees began to shed
their leaves as if it were already autumn instead
of July. The schools were obliged to close early;
the children came home at eleven o'clock instead
of at one, and announced that they had heat
holidays. For there is a regulation in Germany,
if the thermometer is over a certain degree in
the shade, the school is closed for the rest of the
day. The high schools do not have classes in
the afternoon; the children have six hours lessons
in the morning, with intervals of course for
recreation and drilling. Some headmasters
douche the walls of the school-building with cold
water, and then examine the thermometer; but
children as well as teachers think this a very
mean thing to do.</p>

<p>The school holidays commence at the beginning
of July, not in August, as is the case in England.
This year the two little girls, Trudel and Lottchen,
and their mother were going to stay at a
farm, which was situated high up in the midst
of the most lovely woods. Trudel, I must tell
you, was ten years old, and Lottchen eight; they
both went to the same school. This farm was an
inn at the same time; but very few people visited
it during the week, and by nine o'clock the house
was empty of guests; for the woodways were
hardly safe at night. It was easy to get lost in
those vast forests where one path so closely
resembles the other.</p>

<p>It was a long climb up from the station; the
children began to flag, and mother was tired.
Father had come with them to settle them in; but
he could not stay longer than the first day or
two; for his holidays did not begin till August.
He invented all sorts of games for getting along
quicker; he deposited chocolate on stones or tree-stumps
by the wayside, which was discovered by
the children with a shout of joy. Then just as
Lottchen's legs were beginning to ache badly,
and she was nearly crying, he helped them on by
telling the story of the assassination of Julius
C&aelig;sar. Trudel had read about it in her history-book
at school; but it was written in such
dreadfully historical language that she had not
understood the story; she found it thrillingly
interesting as father told it. Lottchen said that
she could never have treated her little friend
Hansi so cruelly, and that she hated that man
Brutus.</p>

<p>At last they reached the end of the woodpath,
and there lay Waldheim&mdash;for so the farm was
called&mdash;before them. A big dog sprang out to
meet them. Mother and Lottchen shrank back
from his rough welcome; but Trudel was soon
ordering him about, and did not seem in the least
surprised when he obeyed her. His name was
Bruno. The farm consisted of a group of
buildings; two houses, one for the farm labourers
and the maids, the other for guests. There were
also large barns which had been newly erected,
and a pond.</p>

<p>Round the houses were fields belonging to the
farm, and then everywhere woods, woods, woods.
Blue mountain-crests were visible above and
beyond the woods.</p>

<p>The children partly unpacked the boxes themselves;
for mother was still so tired. They even
took off her boots and put on her shoes for her,
like kind little daughters, and Trudel put away
their clothes neatly in the cupboard. Then they
all went downstairs joyfully to a cosy tea, which,
I need hardly say, they enjoyed very much after
their long walk and journey.</p>

<p>After tea all fatigue vanished, and the children
flew out to inspect the premises for themselves.
The farmer had two boys of about the same age
as Trudel and Lottchen. Their names were
Hermann and Fritz. Hermann was very shy;
he hid himself at first and peeped out at the
strange girls from corners of the yard or barns,
rushing away when they caught sight of him.
However Trudel soon coaxed him out, and they
all played ball together.</p>

<p>Then Hermann and Fritz took the girls round
the farm. They went first into the cow-shed;
there were fourteen cows, seven calves and a bull.
The cow-herd was a strange, uncanny-looking
fellow with a great shock of red hair, and a very
red face. He shouted at the children in a
dreadful hoarse voice; they felt frightened of him
at first, and thought he was mad; but they soon
found out that the poor fellow was only deaf and
dumb. The cows were his intimate friends. He
had christened each one of them when they were
born: Sophie, Emma, and so on. After they had
gone home again, the children learnt to their
pride that he had named two new calves after
them, Trudel and Lotty.</p>

<p>There were four horses that were used for
driving and ploughing. Lottchen was especially
fond of horses. She liked to see them come home
from the field by themselves and walk straight
into the stable with a noble air, like a lord
returning to his castle. Her favourite horse was
called Hector. Lotty noticed one day that he
was left alone in the stable, whilst the other
horses were ploughing in the field. The stable-door
was open, and after a while to her surprise
he walked out. "What is he going to do? I
hope he will not run away and get lost," thought
Lotty anxiously. But no, he just walked
leisurely up to the field where the other horses
were hard at work and looked on! It was
evidently dull in the stable and he wanted a
little distraction. When he was tired of watching
his friends, he returned to the stable, where
he was found innocently munching hay as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Pigs of course were there too in plenty; they
ran about everywhere, grunting and snorting;
also geese and chickens. Trudel liked to drive
the geese into the water; she was fond of commanding,
as her little sister sometimes knew to
her cost.</p>

<p>The maids were two peasant girls who wore
very short full skirts and a great many petticoats.
Their dress was a modification of the wonderful
Hessen peasant costume. These girls were ready
to do anything for the children. Gustel, who
was chief waitress and chambermaid at the same
time, said that she had never seen such pretty
"kindersche" (little children) in all her life
before!</p>

<p>The only other guest in the house at this time
was a Herr Baron; he told wonderful stories of
his adventures in South America.</p>

<p>"Drought," he said, "yes, that's very bad,
but floods may be worse. I have known years
of labour destroyed in one night by a flood. All
the beautiful fields of grain, our sole wealth. I
lived at that time with my married sister and
her family, and we had only just time to rescue
ourselves and the children. I was the last to
leave the house which we were never to see again.
I could not decide which of my possessions to
take with me, so I seized up the skin of a puma
that I had shot on another memorable occasion,
and bore it off on my shoulder, like Jason
carrying the golden fleece, and that was all that
was left of my personal property. Ah! it needs
patience to conquer the elements," he said.</p>

<p>Altogether the Herr Baron was a wonderful
character; he seemed as if he were not real, but
had stepped out of a book of romance. He
delighted in reading English stories; he was
especially fond of "She" and "King Solomon's
Mines." The children believed that he smoked
day and night; for they had never seen him
without a cigarette, except at meal-times.</p>

<p>He told father and mother the story of how he
had had a bullet extracted from his side that he
had carried about with him for years. It had
struck him during one of the revolutions that so
frequently go on in South America. The bullet
had recently set up inflammation, and a dangerous
operation was necessary to remove it. "Chloroform!
not if I know it," he said to the doctors.
"Just you let me smoke my cigar, and I shall be
all right. I won't say 'Oh!'"</p>

<p>The doctors were naturally very astonished and
demurred at this new method of treatment; but
he persisted in his determination, and the cigar
never left his mouth till the painful business was
successfully over!</p>

<p>The Herr Baron was a mysterious person; why
he lived for months together in that lonely spot,
no one knew. True, he was fond of hunting, and
went out at nights with the landlord to hunt the
stag.</p>

<p>There were hunting-boxes made of logs of
wood, with steps that led up into them, placed
in different positions in the woods near the inn.</p>

<p>The children loved to climb up into them. A
hunting-box made such a nice airy room, they
said; but mother was glad when they were down
again without broken limbs.</p>

<p>Mother was surprised when she entered the
inn-parlour to find the Herr Baron engaged in
a game of quartette with Trudel and Lottchen
and Fritz. Indeed he was so sociable and kind
and fond of children that she thought it was a
pity that he had none of his own.</p>

<p>On the pond near the house were two most
remarkable-looking boats. These Hermann and
Fritz had made themselves with the aid, I
believe, of the Herr Baron. They had a long
stick and punted about in them on the water,
and they managed them quite cleverly. To
Trudel and Lottchen they seemed to suggest
Robinson Crusoe and all sorts of fine adventures.</p>

<p>One day when mother was reading a book
which absorbed her attention, and so was safe
not to interfere with them, they thought, the
children stole down to the pond. Hermann and
Fritz were waiting for them. It was a pre-conceived
plan. "Come along and get in," they
shouted to the girls.</p>

<p>"I daren't," said Lottchen. "Mother would
be so cross; she has forbidden us to go near the
water."</p>

<p>"You are surely not going to spoil the fun,"
said Trudel. "Come along; I'm going to get in
first. I can swim, you know!"</p>

<p>"But not in mud and water-weeds," said
Lottchen wisely.</p>

<p>The boys began to laugh at them.</p>

<p>"Why, you're funky, I do believe; the pond
isn't really deep anywhere," they said.</p>

<p>So with beating hearts the children got into
the boats, Trudel with Fritz, and Hermann,
who was the eldest of the party, with Lottchen.
It was splendid, quite a real adventure.</p>

<p>"Sit still in the middle of the boat," said
Fritz; "I think we had better keep near the bank."</p>

<p>"It's going down on my side; O dear, what
shall I do?" said Trudel. "I don't like it! I
want to get out."</p>

<p>"You're a bit too heavy and upset the
balance," said Fritz. "Very well, then, get out!"</p>

<p>Trudel tried to do so; but the boat was very
wobbly. It was not so easy; her foot slipped,
and in she stepped with one foot into the deep
mud. She grasped convulsively hold of a willow
bush that grew on the bank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hermann, seeing the predicament
they were in, jumped out of his boat, leaving
poor Lottchen quite alone. She began to scream
with all her might and main, and she could make
a fine noise when she chose.</p>

<p>Mother heard the cries though she was some
way off and flew to the pond.</p>

<p>The maids who were bleaching the linen in
the meadow, came running to the rescue as well,
as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>Lotty was soon helped out of the boat. Trudel
had rescued herself with Hermann's assistance,
and she looked very red and ashamed of herself.
She said she did not wish for any more Robinson
Crusoe adventures of that sort. Mother naturally
gave the children a good talking to; but she
thought they had been punished enough this time
for their disobedience, by the fright they had
had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<h4><span class="smallcaps">The Tree Man</span></h4>

<p>There was a tree in the garden that was ideal
to climb, and mother allowed the children to do
so, for she had been very fond of climbing herself
when she was a child.</p>

<p>They wore old serge skirts and jerseys that
they could not spoil.</p>

<p>This tree made a splendid arbour, or house with
a suite of rooms. Lottchen sat up in the branches
like a little bird, and like a little bird she sang
all the songs she knew. From this tree you could
see the mountain called the Stellerskuppe and
the blue sky through the tree-stems on the
summit. At sunset time, the sky behind the
trees turned a golden colour, till it looked like
a picture of fairyland.</p>

<p>It was a fine view, but still you could not see
from here the famous oak-tree, where the little
green tree man lived. This was ten minutes'
walk from the farm.</p>

<p>Trudel and Lottchen saw him first on a wet
day when they had set out for a walk in spite of
the rain, with their green waterproof cloaks on
with hoods over their heads, looking for all the
world like wood-goblins themselves. They were
walking down a narrow green path, and mother
was some distance behind.</p>

<p>"Do just look, Trudel," said Lottchen. "I
believe there is a little man in that hollow tree!"</p>

<p>"So there is, he is smiling and bowing to us,
let's go and visit him," said Trudel, always
enterprising.</p>

<p>Lottchen hung back, feeling a little afraid;
she was always on the look-out for the unexpected,
and yet was surprised when something
really happened.</p>

<p>"Come along, darling," said Trudel, grasping
her smaller sister by the hand.</p>

<p>They both distinctly saw the little man; they
said they could have drawn him afterwards, and
indeed they attempted to do so as well as they
could. But as they approached the venerable
oak, the little man vanished, and all they saw
was a strange green stain on the inside of the
tree, resembling a dwarf with a peaked hood on.</p>

<p>"Just look at this Gothic window," said
Lottchen, proud of her knowledge of the word
"Gothic." "How nicely this tree-room is
carved. I am sure <i>he</i> lives here; where are his
little chairs and tables? I should love to see
them."</p>

<p>They peeped through a window or hole in the
old tree and saw their mother approaching.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, here lives a real tree man;
we saw him&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

<p>Mother smiled&mdash;what the children called her
mysterious smile.</p>

<p>"You look like two little wood-men yourselves,"
she said. "Lottchen, stand up straight
in the hole and look at me."</p>

<p>Lottchen stood up just fitting into the green
mark on the tree behind her. She made a pretty
picture, her laughing brown eyes with the long
eyelashes, her rosy cheeks, and the wind-blown
hair straying from under her hood.</p>

<p>"O look, Lottchen, here is a little basin of
holy water, just like we saw in the cathedral,"
said Trudel.</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

</div>

<p class="noindent">said a tiny voice that sounded like that of a
wood-bird.</p>

<p>"Mother! did <i>you</i> hear anything, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darlings, the birds are singing so sweetly
now the rain is over. I have brought my camp-stool.
I shall sit here and sketch the tree," said
mother.</p>

<p>"Do draw <i>him</i>," said Trudel, whose blue eyes
were open wider than usual.</p>

<p>"Him! Whom do you mean?" said mother.</p>

<p>"Why, the tree man, of course."</p>

<p>"Hum," said mother mysteriously, "we'll
see," and she settled herself down to sketch.</p>

<p>The children collected huge acorns, and laid
them on a leaf in the hollow tree. Then they
stirred up the brackish "holy" water and put
their fingers in it.</p>

<p>"It smells like lavender and roses," said
Lottchen.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got a funny nose; it smells
to me like blackberry and apple-tart," said
Trudel.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;he!" said a little voice again.
Somebody was laughing. Where could he be?
Glancing round quickly the children saw a little
man about three feet high, dressed in green,
wearing a long peaked cap with a wreath of tiny
oak-leaves around it. He looked very strong,
although he was small, and he stuck his arms
out akimbo in a curious angular way like the
branches of an oak-tree.</p>

<p>"How did you know that trees were alive?"
he asked the children.</p>

<p>They were embarrassed by the question.</p>

<p>"Why, of course we know they are not dead,
unless they are cut down," they said.</p>

<p>The little man shuddered; then he began to
wave his arms about wildly.</p>

<p>"<i>Let</i> them try to cut me down, I'll knock
them down. I'll fall on them and crush their
bones. I'll smash them like this stone!" Here
he gave a stone that stood near by, such a
tremendous whack that sparks flew out of it.</p>

<p>"Don't smash us, please, Mr Tree Man," said
Lottchen trembling.</p>

<p>"No fear, little Miss Lottchen, no fear, you're
a nice little thing, you are; one can see that to
look at you. You would <i>never</i> cut me down,
would you?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not," said Lotty.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should not dream of such a thing either,"
said Trudel. "But may we ask who you are?"
Trudel continued, "You are surely not a tree?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this," said the little man;
"I'm a tree, and the tree's me!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>," said Trudel, correcting him, "would be
more correct."</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said the little man, "Pedantic
rot!&mdash;the tree's <i>me</i>, I repeat. Every tree has its
gnome or elf; they used to call us dryads in old
times; but nowadays people are getting so cock-sure
of knowing everything, that they can't see
what is going on right under their noses. Trees
are never still," he continued; "they are always
moving.</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="text">
<tr><td align="left">"'Where there is movement, there is life,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is life, there is thought,</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p>"Do you follow me? That is logically
expressed."</p>

<p>"You forget we are only children, Mr Tree
Man; you are talking too grown-upy for us.
Father talks like that sometimes; but then we
don't listen," they replied.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the gnome, "in every tree
there either lives a jolly fellow like me or a lovely
lady fairy. Yes," he said in a sentimental tone,
"I, too, old and tough though I am, I, too,
have known love."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Trudel eagerly.</p>

<p>"Alas! I can never reach her; my old bones
are too stiff and unbendable. She is a graceful
larch-tree in all the glory of her youth. You
may see her yonder!" He sat down and sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>The children looked in the direction that the
gnome had indicated, and there they saw a larch-tree
on which the sunlight had just fallen. It
was exquisitely dressed in a robe of delicate
green and&mdash;was it only fancy?&mdash;for one moment
the children thought that they saw a lovely lady
with flowing tresses that gleamed golden in the
sunlight, and large starry eyes. As they gazed,
she melted into the blue mist which shimmers
always between the forest trees.</p>

<p>"Now we must go home, children," mother
called out, "before it begins to rain again."</p>

<p>The children glanced round; their little friend
had vanished, and no trace was to be seen of the
lady of the larch-tree. So they turned reluctantly
from the tree-house fully determined to come
again very soon to this enchanted spot.</p>

<p>"Mother, may we see your sketch?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said mother, "it's going to be a
surprise."</p>

<p>"Did mother see him too?"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Lottchen. "Mother's
a fairy herself."</p>

<p>"I think," said Trudel, "she sees all sorts of
queer things; but she won't tell us everything
she sees."</p>

<p>"It spoils some things to tell about them,"
said Lottchen. "I shan't tell Hermann and
Fritz about the tree man."</p>

<p>However, when she got home again, she could
not contain herself. "Do you believe in fairies
and tree men?" she said to the boys.</p>

<p>"Of course not, that's all rot," said Hermann.
"Like Santa Claus and such things, just
invented to stuff us up!"</p>

<p>"Santa Claus will never come to you any more
if you talk like that; <i>he</i> is <i>quite true</i>, I know.
Trudel saw him come in last year when she was
in bed, and she heard him filling our stockings.
Of course she did not dare to turn round and
look at him," said Lottchen.</p>

<p>"I don't say it isn't nice to believe such
things," said Hermann conscientiously, "but it
isn't true; it's superstitious. You know quite
well, Trudel, who Santa Claus really is."</p>

<p>Trudel was silent; she was ten years old, and
she had her doubts.</p>

<p>"But I've seen a tree man to-day," said
Lotty.</p>

<p>The boys laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't try to stuff us up with such nonsense;
we're not so green as your tree man," they said.</p>

<p>Gustel, the maid, came in, and joined in the
conversation. She supported the boys' view.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Lottchen, now in a high
state of excitement. "My mother knows a man&mdash;a
very clever Irishman&mdash;a poet and a painter
as well, and he has often seen the fairies."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trudel, "it's true he draws them
just as he sees them with rainbow-coloured
wings."</p>

<p>"Well I never, you don't expect me to believe
such things, do you?" said Gustel. "Why,
that's all lies, and it is very wicked to tell a
lie!"</p>

<p>Lotty flew into a perfect tantrum. "How
dare you say we tell lies; I will tell my mother
of you," she screamed, and threw herself on the
floor crying violently.</p>

<p>Mother rushed in, not knowing what had
happened. "Lotty, get up at once; tell me
what's the matter, darling!"</p>

<p>"Booh!&mdash;booh&mdash;booh!&mdash;Gustel won't believe&mdash;booh,
booh, booh&mdash;that you know a man who
has seen the fairies!"</p>

<p>Mother could not help laughing. "Don't be
so absurd, Lotty. Of course Gustel does not
understand what you mean. Gustel," she said,
"you are a Catholic and believe in the saints;
they saw very queer things too, sometimes, didn't
they?"</p>

<p>"O yes, you're right; of course, ma'am," said
Gustel, feeling embarrassed; for she had no
arguments to support her disbelief in fairies.</p>

<p>"Some people can see more than others," continued
mother. "Now if I were to tell you that
I could see the old poacher or wild huntsman
who used to live in this house, riding through
the yard on a moonlight night, what would you
say?"</p>

<p>"Lor, ma'am, if I saw him, I should die of
fright," said Gustel, turning pale.</p>

<p>"But you know that there are no such things
as ghosts and fairies!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, very true, ma'am, it's rather
confusing what you say," said poor Gustel,
feeling her head in a whirl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a wonderful moonlight night. As
father was still away, mother sat by herself in
the big bedroom, whilst the children slept in the
little room adjoining. There was a very high
wind; the window-panes rattled; the wooden
shutters blew to and fro; the branches of the trees
made weird patterns on the ground. The moonlight
was so white that the fields and paths
looked almost as if they were covered with snow.
The Stellerskuppe stood out black against the
sky. As mother gazed, it seemed to her as if
strange creatures were abroad that night, driven
to and fro by that tireless hunter, the wind.
Wild forms passed by and gazed at her with
deathless eyes; for a while she remained there
motionless, as under a spell. Then suddenly she
remembered her joke about the old huntsman of
evil repute, who had formerly lived in this farmhouse.
Did his ghost haunt it still? Mother
shivered; the nights were cold up in the
mountains, though it was such a hot summer. She
opened the door of the children's room and peeped
in. To tell the truth, she felt a little creepy,
and longed for human companionship. There
were her darlings, sleeping soundly; but as she
entered the room Trudel turned round and flung
herself on the other side of the bed, saying: "Go
away, go away, do not come near me!"</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean, darling?" said mother
anxiously.</p>

<p>Then Trudel groaned and spoke again in her
sleep. She uttered the following deep and
mystic words: "Gustel, bring in the shark,
please; mother can't eat the thimble."</p>

<p>Now, wasn't that a funny thing for a little girl
to say in her sleep. Mother was so amused that
she wrote the words down on the spot, so as not
to forget them, and she troubled her head no
more with thoughts of the wild huntsman; indeed
the spectres of the night vanished as they always
do vanish at a joke!</p>

<p>Some days passed, before the children visited
the oak-tree again. When they did so, they
found that an enormous branch had been broken
off, and lay across the green pathway.</p>

<p>"O dear me," said Lottchen, "our <i>poor</i> little
man. I hope it hasn't hurt him!"</p>

<p>"It must have happened on that windy night,"
said Trudel.</p>

<p>"It was my own fault, it was entirely my own
fault," said a queer little voice, and there was the
oak-tree man sitting in his house smoking a reed
pipe. His arm was bound up with green fern
leaves. "Yes, it was my own fault; the wind
excited me, and stirred my sap (that's my blood
you know)&mdash;I stretched out my arms towards her&mdash;one
embrace&mdash;one blessed moment in which to
call her mine&mdash;and here you see me a cripple for
ever!"</p>

<p>"O <i>poor</i> thing, we are so sorry for you," said
the children.</p>

<p>"Never mind, it heals easily," said the oak
man, "but, alas, my beauty and my symmetry
are gone for ever!"</p>

<p>"Your leaves are so nice and fresh; and your
house is so pretty; why, you have got furniture
in it," said the children in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Such a pretty oak table and beautifully
carved chairs; where did you get them from?"
asked Lottchen.</p>

<p>"I made them myself out of my own wood;
it cheered me up a bit," said the little man.
"One must do something, you know; looks snug,
doesn't it? Ah, well&mdash;I have known love, that
is something to be proud of; I have experienced
the most pleasing of human emotions. Have you
ever been in love?" he said inquisitively, looking
at Trudel, who looked big enough in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why no, not exactly, we're only kiddies; but
still we do love lots of people, of course," said
she.</p>

<p>"Your day will come, your day will come.
Do not desire the unattainable, but content yourself
with the reachable," he said; "and yet ''Tis
better to have loved and lost than never to have
loved at all,' as the dear old poem says."</p>

<p>"He's getting grand in his language again;
he <i>is</i> a funny little man," said Trudel in a
whisper to Lottchen.</p>

<p>"Stay," said the tree man, "I have a good
idea; I will give you a card of introduction to
<i>her</i>, my beloved Lady Larch-tree."</p>

<p>He gave them an oak leaf with the words:
"Edle Eiche," printed on it, which is in English
Noble Oak.</p>

<p>"You need not say anything; she will know it
comes from me," he said, sighing sentimentally.</p>

<p>Full of curiosity, the children turned to go to
the larch-tree, which was only a few steps further
down the green pathway. The ardent lover
watched the children from the window of his little
house. They knocked three times on the bark of
the larch-tree; and they were very pleased when
a door opened in the tree, and a lovely lady was
revealed to them. Her dress was of green, looped
up with tiny pink flowers such as grow on the
larches in early spring; her hair streamed down
like a soft veil about her. She hardly seemed to
see the children at first, when they presented
their cards. She took the oak-leaf cards and
pressed them to her heart.</p>

<p>"Heart of oak! King of the forest! for ever
mine," she murmured, and her words were like
the sound that a little brook makes when it
trickles beneath dark forest trees.</p>

<p>"He sends you his love," said the children
politely.</p>

<p>"You dear little things," said Lady Larch;
"it was so kind of you to come and call on me.
So you understand trees and their language,
dear, dear, so young and so clever! <i>Would</i> you
like some wood wine?"</p>

<p>"Not if it is dirty water with caterpillars in
it," said Trudel.</p>

<p>"O dear no, it is purified and refined; it is
most delicious." So saying, she handed each of
them a large acorn cup full; and they drank the
contents.</p>

<p>"It does taste nice, dear fairy," said the
children, "like what we make ourselves at a
doll's feast. May we ask you for some more?"</p>

<p>"No, no, it is very strong, and would get into
your heads, and you would find out all about&hellip;. No, I'm sorry &hellip; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Children," said mother's voice, "where are
you? I have been looking for you."</p>

<p>"We have only been to call on Lady Larch,
mother; she has shut her door tight again or we
would have introduced you to her," said Lotty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PART III</h3>

<p>They came home rather late that evening and
found the farm in a great state of commotion.
The red-haired cow-herd was shouting and crying
in an unintelligible way; the house seemed to be
deserted. They met the Herr Baron also preparing
to set out in a hurry.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Where is everybody?"
said mother.</p>

<p>"The silly old cow-herd has lost one of the best
cows; it has strayed off among the bushes, and
may die if it is exposed all night. Who knows
where the poor creature may have got to in these
vast woods?"</p>

<p>The search went on till late at night; the men,
including the Herr Baron, walked miles with
their lanterns, but in vain. The deaf mute was
in a dreadful state of mind and kept crying out
in his harsh, disagreeable voice: "Not my fault&mdash;<i>Schimmel</i>'s
fault." (Schimmel was the
cow.)</p>

<p>It was difficult enough to sleep that night; but
when mother had at last dropped into a light
doze, it must have been about four o'clock in the
morning, she and the children were aroused by
a great shouting and disturbance in the house.
They looked out of the window and&mdash;what do you
think?&mdash;there was the lost cow, who had returned
after all of her own accord. And with her a dear
little black and white calf, who frisked and
bounded along as if it thought it was fine fun to
be in the world on this lovely morning. Now
wasn't that a queer thing, children, queerer than
all the fairy stories you have read? for this story
is quite true, you must know!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an exceptionally fine Sunday, and as
father had come down to spend the week-end,
mother and the children were in the seventh
heaven of joy. It was not possible to go to
church; for the nearest town was two hours' walk
away, and would be partly over fields that were
exposed to the heat of the midday sun. So father
and mother and their two little daughters went
to the great woodland cathedral.</p>

<p>The service was on the Stellerskuppe; surely
no one could wish for a more beautiful place of
worship. Mountain after mountain ranged in the
distance, some with rounded or knolled heads,
others rising to a peak. Lottchen called the
most pointed one Mesuvius, because she always
forgot the "V."</p>

<p>As the children sat there and sang hymns, with
their white Sunday frocks on, mother fancied
that eyes were peering at them from out the forest
depths. If they were merely those of the gentle
deer, or if stranger creatures still were watching
them as if fascinated, she did not know: she felt
there were lookers-on. There is the old story of
the God Pan who played so divinely that all living
things came to listen to him. Perhaps there may
be a stirring at times in the souls of the mysterious
dwellers in the forest that makes them yearn
for immortality and gives them a fuller sense of
existence. So that all the woodland sang too at
that Sunday service.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon, father and mother
wanted to go for a longer walk than usual; but
the lazy children petitioned to be left behind.</p>

<p>"You will promise not to go near the pond,"
said mother. "Remember it is Sunday, and you
have your best frocks on; you must not romp or
climb trees."</p>

<p>"O no, mother, of course not," said Trudel.
"We'll stay in the garden and promise to be
very good."</p>

<p>When father and mother returned from their
walk, the first thing they saw was Lottchen staggering
along with a stand of empty beer-bottles.</p>

<p>"Whatever are you doing, Lottchen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, there are such heaps of people
here this afternoon, and there are not enough
waitresses to serve them; so Trudel and I are
helping. Trudel has got such a lot of tips
already; she has bought chocolate with the
money. Do tell her to divide it fairly with me!"</p>

<p>Mother looked round. The whole place was
covered with tables and benches; a number of
gaily dressed people from the neighbouring town
were drinking coffee and eating cake or waffeln, a
kind of pancake for which the inn was celebrated.</p>

<p>"Mother, don't speak to me, I'm too busy,"
said Trudel. "I've been waiting on those
gentlemen; the maids were shy of them, so I
said I would go and ask what they wanted."
She pointed out some young men in officers'
uniform, who had come from a military school.
"I've got 6d. in tips, and I spent it on chocolate."</p>

<p>"Well I never!" said mother, astonished at
her daughter's prowess&mdash;"you have turned into
a waitress, and on Sunday afternoon too. Whatever
would your aunts say?"</p>

<p>"I think I had better tell you what the young
men said to me," said Trudel seriously. "They
said I was a sweet little thing, and that if I were
older, they would fall in love with me. I laughed
of course; I could see they were only silly old
stupid heads. I told them they had not much
taste; for their military school was the ugliest
building in all the town. They quite agreed
with me about this, however, and then they
asked me who my father was, and when I said he
was a professor, they laughed till I thought they
would burst. But now you must excuse me,
really, mother darling. I have promised to go
into the kitchen and wash up cups and saucers!"</p>

<p>The landlady could not praise Trudel enough.
Such a useful little girl, she does everything in
a most orderly way and wipes down the table
when she has finished! "If ever you want her
to learn housekeeping, pray send her to me, I
should be delighted to teach her," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," thought mother, "and make a nice little
slavey of her into the bargain. No, no, our
Trudel is not going to turn into a housemaid!"</p>

<p>If Trudel had been some years older, father
and mother might have objected to these experiences;
but, as it was, they only laughed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PART IV</h3>

<p>As the world is full of fact and fancy, so is
this story. Whether it is based mostly on fact
or on fancy we will leave to the German philosophers
to decide, but I have heard that they are
doubtful on this point, with regard to the world,
I mean.</p>

<p>It was a magical evening. Trudel was so
engrossed in a game of cards with the boys that
she could not be induced to come out; moreover
she had a slight cold and the evenings were
chilly. A glorious sunset glow illumined the sky
as mother and Lottchen set out for their never-to-be-forgotten
walk.</p>

<p>"We will go up and see the fire on the heath;
I love the smell of dry pine wood burning," said
mother.</p>

<p>"I love to see the fire dancing and crackling,"
said Lottchen. "How still everything is."</p>

<p>"It is the calm of twilight. The wind usually
drops in the evening," said mother.</p>

<p>"Look, look, over there by those dark woods
there is something moving," said Lotty. "I
think it is a white cat."</p>

<p>"A white cat! How queer that she should
have strayed so far; she does not belong to the
farm, I know."</p>

<p>"Hush! perhaps she is not a cat at all&mdash;then
she will vanish." And lo and behold when they
looked again, there was no cat there, though they
had distinctly seen it a minute before on the
field at the wood's edge.</p>

<p>"She is really a witch, I believe," said mother,
with the curious expression on her face that Lotty
knew so well.</p>

<p>Going further up the hill, they saw a wonderful
sight. Twenty or more peasant girls were
busy working, hacking the ground, their faces
illuminated by the wonderful sunset glow. They
wore short full peasant skirts edged with bright-coloured
ribbons, and each had a gaily coloured
scarf pinned round the neck and bodice.</p>

<p>We learned afterwards that they were preparing
the ground to plant young fir-trees on a
clearing. Germans are so careful of their woods,
they replant what has been cut down, so that
they have a great wealth in wood that we cannot
boast of in England. I believe that they would
<i>like</i> to cut off all the dead branches in order to
make the woods quite tidy! But this would be
rather too big a job even for the German nation
to accomplish!</p>

<p>A man dressed in green with a feather in his
cap, and a gun over his shoulder stood by
watching the girls at their work.</p>

<p>He was a forester and seemed to act as
overseer. He gave the signal to stop work as
the strangers (mother and Lotty) approached.
The women hid their tools under the dry heather
until the next day, and then strapped on the big
baskets they carried on their backs, without
which they hardly felt properly dressed. They
then marched along together, singing a melodious
song in unison. As they came to the cross-roads
they parted company; some went this way, some
that; all kept up the tune, which echoed farther
and farther, fainter and fainter in the distance.</p>

<p>Before long Lottchen and her mother were
alone; but they felt that the ground they stood
on, was enchanted. Mother said it was like a
scene from the opera. They watched the fire;
how the flames leaped and crackled; yet they
were dying down. The fire made a bright contrast
to the dark fir-woods which formed the
background to the picture. The glory died from
the sky; but yet it was strangely light; darker
and darker grew the woods near the fire. Suddenly
Lotty espied bright sparks among the trees.</p>

<p>"I do believe they have set the wood on fire,"
said mother.</p>

<p>"O no, mother, don't you see; let us crouch
down and hide; it is the fairies: they are coming
to the fire."</p>

<p>The air was suddenly full of bright beings.</p>

<p>And all this Trudel had missed. It seemed
too great a pity, with that silly old card playing.</p>

<p>Spellbound mother and Lotty watched the
fairies at their revels, till Lottchen began to
shiver.</p>

<p>"We really must go home," whispered
mother. "Trudel will be anxious."</p>

<p>"Oh, but mother I want to dance round the
fire with the fairies, and I want a fairy wand
with shooting stars," said Lotty almost aloud.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed as if the fairies became
aware that they were observed. They vanished
away, and all became dark. Lottchen said she
could hear the sound of little feet stamping out
the fire.</p>

<p>"Fairies, dear fairies, come again, do," said
Lotty.</p>

<p>No answer, perfect stillness, not even a leaf
stirred.</p>

<p>"Well, you are not so polite as our tree man,
not half," said Lotty, "though you are so
pretty. Good night," she shouted.</p>

<p>There was a sound of suppressed laughter;
then from hill and dale the word "good night"
was echoed all around. Spellbound, as if in a
trance, they moved toward the farm. Trudel was
wild with herself when she heard what she had
missed.</p>

<p>"<i>To-morrow</i>," she said, but to-morrow is sometimes
a long, long way off, and the fairies did not
show themselves again during these holidays.</p>

<p>One of Lottchen's favourite walks was the
echo walk, but she usually came home quite
hoarse after having been this way. The path
wound below the fairy heath on the incline of
the hill; further down still were the fir-woods
through which the light shone.</p>

<p>"Angel-pet!" "Cherry-ripe!" "Cheeky fellow!"
"You're another!" So Lotty shouted
the whole time, and the echoes came back so
surprisingly distinct that Lotty was sure it must
be really the fairies answering her. When you
turned the corner of the hill, the echoes ceased.
It was too queer.</p>

<p>The next day Trudel distinguished herself
again. Two great cart-loads of swedes arrived
that were to be stored up as fodder for the cattle
in the winter. Now the joy was to throw these
through a hole in the wall into the cellar.
Hermann stood in the cart and Trudel threw
the swedes to him as the bricklayers throw the
bricks to one another. Fritz and Lottchen
helped too; they had to take their turn and be
very quick, as the hole was small. Hour after
hour this went on, till the children were as black
as chimney sweeps, and yet Trudel's energy did
not fail. At last the carts were empty, and
only then did the little workers leave off, dead
tired.</p>

<p>Hermann could make curious heads out of the
swedes, with eyes and nose and mouth. If you
put an old candle-end inside, they looked ghastly,
like some Chinese god. Lotty declared that they
rolled about in the yard at night and grinned at
her, and that she did not like "heads without
people."</p>

<p>"But they <i>are</i> so funny, Lottchen," said
mother, and then she laughed at them and was
not frightened any more.</p>

<p>In the fields grew nice little buttony mushrooms.
No one knew better than the Herr Baron
where they were to be found and how to prepare
them. Apparently he had lived on mushrooms
in the wilds of South America. He was very
kind in helping the children to fill their baskets
to take home with them; for, alas, even the
pleasantest of holidays must come to an end; and
there was only one day left. He discovered a
treasure in the field, a little mother-of-pearl
knife, very old and rusty, and presented it to
Trudel. He told her to soak it in petroleum to
clean it. That knife was more trouble than all
the rest of the luggage on the way back, for
Trudel made such a fuss about it, and dissolved
in tears several times when she thought that she
had lost it.</p>

<p>To leave the beautiful cool woods, the fairies,
the tree man and his sweetheart, the cows and
the geese and all the marvels of the country, yes,
it was hard; but home is home, and always turns
a smiling face to us after a long absence. How
nice to rediscover one's playthings and dolls.
Trudel's first thought was always for her doll
babies, and she would rush upstairs, and embrace
each one tenderly.</p>

<p>As the children drove to the station from the
farm, they passed the famous oak-tree, but no
little man was to be seen.</p>

<p>"He's shy of the coachman, of course," said
the children.</p>

<p>Looking back, they caught a glimpse of him
in the distance, and shouted and waved their
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Hermann and Fritz were very sorry to say
"good-bye" to their little friends; but school
began the next day, and they would not have so
much time for play then.</p>

<p>The landlady told the children a great secret
before they left. "The Herr Baron is going to
be married next week," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad," said mother. "I hope she
is very nice," and the children echoed the wish
warmly.</p>

<p>"She has lots of money, and is a countess, I
believe," continued the landlady.</p>

<p>"Well, I do hope she does not object to
smoking," said Trudel, and they all laughed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mother, you have never shown us your
sketch," said Trudel during the unpacking.</p>

<p>Mother laughed. "Where's Lottchen? I
suppose she wants to see it too?"</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Lotty. "Oh, do be quick
and show it to us!"</p>

<p>Mother held up the sketch. There was the
hollow oak-tree, and standing in it the little tree
man himself just as the children had first seen
him, with his green peaked hood on.</p>

<p>"So mother really did see him too!" said the
children.</p>

<p>Now this story disproves the common fallacy
that only children can see the fairies and forest
folk; for how could mother have painted the tree
gnome unless she had seen him?</p>
